		  	<p><i>Such hope never disappoints or deludes or shames us, for God’s love has been poured out in our hearts through the Holy Spirit Who has been given to us. (Romans 5:5)</i></p>
		  	


		  	<blockquote>I wouldn’t dare to drive a car if I never hoped to get to my destination; hope is the fuel that pushes a car to its destination. If your journey is not fuelled by hope, you cannot go far.</blockquote>

		  	<p>Hope is an anticipation and desire that something is going to happen in your favor. It is the expectation that crooked lines will fall in pleasant places and be made straight.</p>
		  	<p>Before a man could have attained any height in life, he must have hoped for it. Verily, not many men have achieved anything without the least iota of its expectation. For it to be achievable, it’s got to be expectable.</p>
		  	<p>When you expect the best to happen, you work towards making it happen in good time; great hope propels men to carry on great tasks. Without hope, there’d be no motivation, drive or inspiration to any goal.</p>
		  	<p>I wouldn’t dare to drive a car if I never hoped to get to my destination; hope is the fuel that pushes a car to its final destination. If your journey in life is not fuelled by hope, you cannot go far.</p>
		  	<p>However, some people have been deluded by hope; when they really thought that better days were ahead, they were disappointed to experience worse days; just when the expectation of them getting a contract grew stronger, they lost it. Such people may have given up on hope, but there’s an extent of truth not yet discovered.</p>
		  	<p>Notice it states, “Such hope never disappoints ...” The writer was not referring to hope in general, but a certain kind of hope. In essence, all other hopes may disappoint you, but it is certain that this kind of hope cannot disappoint, delude or put you to shame.</p>
		  	<p>Studying through the entire chapter, Romans 5, you will gain deeper understanding of the hope referred to.</p>
		  	<p>What kind of hope is spoken about? The hope of eternal salvation, which is founded on the finished work of Christ! Yea, this hope can never disappoint. All other sources of hope are bound to fail, and are tagged with uncertainty, but this hope deludes not.</p>
		  	<p>The song writer rightly states, “My hope is built on nothing less, than Jesus blood and righteousness.” Verily, such hope does not fail!</p>
		  	<p>Many have put their hope in men; and some others in their wealth; but the earlier we realize that any hope founded on anything other than the finished work of Christ, is bound to fail, the less disappointment we get.</p>
		  	<p>Beloved don’t give up on hope; the problem is not hoping, but hoping wrongly. True hope, which fails not, is hope founded on the finished work of Christ.</p>
		  	<p>Henceforth, let this be your hope: Because Christ died for us, we can live above anything. By His finished work on the cross, I was justified and made free; therefore, I am living in liberty. I’m free from debts, free from sin, free from sickness; yea, I am free indeed.</p>
		  	<p>Any hope that is built on the foundation of the finished work of Christ, cannot fail. Never build your hope on anything less. Be blessed!</p>
