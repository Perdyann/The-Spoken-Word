		  	<p><i>This is the day which the Lord hath made; we will rejoice and be glad in it. (Psalm 118:24)</i></p>
		  	<p><i>It is of the Lord’s mercies that we are not consumed, because his compassions fail not. </i></p>
		  	<p><i>They are new every morning: great is thy faithfulness. (Lamentations 3:22-23)</i></p>

		  	<blockquote>Our days are what we make of them; if everyday can be greatly sculpted, we will live a great life.</blockquote>

		  	<p>The mercies of the Lord and His steadfast love are new every morning. It is impossible to exhaust God; He can never run out of mercy and love!</p>
		  	<p>Every new day is made by the Lord, with renewed love and mercy. Therefore, let us rejoice and be glad in it.</p>
		  	<p>Verily, we are the sculptors of our days. We could choose to rejoice every new day, and we could choose to mourn; we could decide to praise God for the brightness of the day, and we could decide to complain; we could decide to make the best out of our days, and we could decide to waste every hour of it.</p>
		  	<p>The day has been filled with God’s love and mercy, but it is left to us to decide what we can make out of the day. The result of everyday emanates from our choices and decisions.</p>
		  	<p>If there’s one question I always look forward to answering, it is — how is your day?—This question poses an opportunity for me to prophesy and confess greatness in the atmosphere. I always respond, “It is so blessed and great; so far, it’s the best day of the year for me!”</p>
		  	<p>Indeed, every single day adds to the length of our lives; if everyday can be greatly sculpted, we will live a great life. We are the ones who define our days and lives.</p>
		  	<p>Sometime ago, a colleague asked me, “how is life treating you?” I carefully responded, “I am treating life so well.” He wore a confused look on his face, as he couldn’t understand my response. Verily, my life and days do not have the ability to treat me in any way; I am the sculptor of my days! My days are what I make of them.</p>
		  	<p>How can you have a great day always? Every new day is an opportunity to speak a new word. Every new morning signifies a new season in the Spirit!</p>
		  	<p>Starting a day well is a vital key to having a great day; in the sense that the latter is always greater than the beginning. Therefore, if a day can start up right, the rest of the day can only get better.</p>
		  	<p>There is no better way to start a day, than by meditation, confession, and prayer in the Holy Ghost. Your day is at your command; speak Spirit filled words every morning; meditate and declare a new Rhema every day!</p>
		  	<p>Speak thus: “This day, lines are falling in pleasant places for me; nature is working in my favor; everything is turning around for my good; I am full of the power, wisdom and knowledge of God; the Holy Ghost functions in my body; I have a sound mind; everything I touch is blessed to prosper; all things are made possible for me; I am such a huge success!”</p>
		  	<p>Define your day as the Spirit leads! We are the sculptors of our days; the day cannot be anything different from what we have made of it. Be blessed!</p>
