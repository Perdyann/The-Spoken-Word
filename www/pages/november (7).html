		  	<p><i>Stand therefore, having your loins girt about with truth, and having on the breastplate of righteousness; (Ephesians 6:14)</i></p>
		  
		  	<blockquote>Anything that is not founded on truth is bound to fail, because it cannot withstand the test of time.</blockquote>

		  	<p>Today, our emphasis will be on the first part of this scripture—Stand therefore, having your loins girt about with truth—Our focus will be on laying a foundation of truth.</p>
		  	<p>Just after we are admonished to put on the whole armor of God, Paul decided to elaborate in details, what he meant by the whole armor of God. He started with truth, and then listed other spiritual weapons.</p>
		  	<p>Notice, truth is the baseline. He did not add truth to righteousness, faith, and others; rather, he added every other virtue to truth. Truth is the foundation of it all.</p>
		  	<p>So often, I have said to many, “Anything that is not founded on truth is bound to fail, because it cannot withstand the test of time.”</p>
		  	<p>So many marriages today are in crises because they were founded on many lies; many are having problems with jobs because their documents are falsified; many have graduated from institutions with results that are not theirs’. Truth is the right foundation; anything contrary to that cannot last.</p>
		  	<p>You might be so desperate to get a spouse, and as a result, cook up many lies. I can only give one assurance; if that false foundation is not healed, you will rush out of that marriage, just with the same speed as you rushed in.</p>
		  	<p>Before we are admonished to put on any other armor, our loins must first be girded with truth. Don’t start building, when you are not sure of the state of the foundation.</p>
		  	<p>We know that the strength of a house founded on sinking sand is nothing compared to that of a house founded on a rock. It takes just a calm breeze and a mild rain to blow a building off sinking sand; but not even a heavy storm can shift a house, whose foundation is the rock.</p>
		  	<p>Beloved, the foundation of your affairs determines the strength and duration of it. You might actually succeed in attaining a great height through falsified means, but how long can you be sustained there?</p>
		  	<p>Truth is the baseline; it is the foundation! We are not told to put on some of the armor of God, but the whole armor. In essence, if any armor is missing, you are not well equipped. If truth is out of place, you still remain vulnerable.</p>
		  	<p>You don’t need to walk out of your marriage when you realize that it is founded on false grounds. There is no foundation that is beyond the healing power of God. God heals and transforms even the messiest foundations.</p>
		  	<p>Don’t get yourself to any place using false means, it is never worth it. Hold on to the truth; that’s the baseline. Be blessed!</p>
