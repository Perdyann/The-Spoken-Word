		  	<p><i>Paul gathered a pile of sticks for the fire. He was putting the sticks on the fire, and a poisonous snake came out because of the heat and bit him on the hand. When the people living on the island saw the snake hanging from his hand, they said, “This man must be a murderer! He did not die in the sea, but Justice does not want him to live.”</i></p>
		  	<p><i>But Paul shook the snake off into the fire and was not hurt. The people thought he would swell up or fall down dead. They waited and watched him for a long time, but nothing bad happened to him. So they changed their opinion. They said, “He is a god!” (Acts 28:3-6) ERV</i></p>

		  	<p>Amazing! Vipers are known to be very venomous reptiles; there are hardly a few people that have survived the bite of a viper. Paul did!</p>
		  	<p>This scripture is very significant, as it portrays a different class of men. Ordinary men consider the venom of snakes to be deadly; they consider some ailments deadly; they consider the sting of scorpions deadly; they consider intake of poison deadly. However, there is a different class of men, who live above all these.</p>
		  	<p>Paul was one of such kinds. Rather than being killed by the venom of the viper, the viper was killed by his divine nature.</p>
		  	<p>Behold how obvious this is: Cancer is deadly to the human nature, but my nature is deadly to cancer; the viper is venomous to the human nature, but I am venomous to viper. Rather than having their venom hurt me, my nature of divinity will kill them.</p>
		  	<p>Cancer cannot survive in my system for a second; vipers can’t survive a clasp of me; my nature is venomous to sickness and infirmity! It is written: </p>
		  	<p><i>And these signs shall follow them that believe; In my name shall they cast out devils; they shall speak with new tongues;</i></p>
		  	<p><i>They shall take up serpents; and if they drink any deadly thing, it shall not hurt them; they shall lay hands on the sick, and they shall recover.</i></p>
		  	<p>Beloved, in believing, we are above the very things that limit the human nature. Things which are deadly to a natural man, regards us as being deadly. An ordinary man would have died to the bite of the viper, rather, the viper died, and Paul remained healthy.</p>
		  	<p>When the crowd had waited for Paul to slump to death, as a result of the bite of the viper, yet he remained healthy, they ceased to condemn him, and called him a god.</p>
		  	<p>People will start by being critical towards us; they will disagree with our mindset and ideas initially, but they definitely can’t argue with our results.</p>
		  	<p>Isn’t it obvious that we play by a different set of rules? Sickness is a natural limit, to the human nature; however, it flees at the sight of a partaker of God’s Divine Nature.</p>
		  	<p>We have got God’s Nature now; anything that does not happen to God cannot happen to us. If God will not die by the venom of a viper, why should I?</p>
		  	<p>Verily brethren, if you know it, and you believe it, you are above natural rules, worldly principles, venom of any kind, sickness, and failure. Our Divine nature places us above all things. Be blessed!</p>
