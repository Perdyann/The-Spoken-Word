		  	<p><i>“Therefore, if you are offering your gift at the altar and there remember that your brother or sister has something against you, leave your gift there in front of the altar. First go and be reconciled to them; then come and offer your gift. (Matthew 5:23-24)</i></p>


		  	<blockquote>“God values your relationship much more than your gift . . . When there is no love, let there be no gift!” </blockquote>

		  	<p>So many times we’ve read this scripture, but handled it indifferently. It takes one to meditate deeply through the lines to realize this one truth. “God values your relationship much more than your gift.”</p>
		  	<p>Sowing of seed to the work of God’s Kingdom cannot be overemphasized. God loves a cheerful giver, and it is even more blessed to give than to receive. However, when it comes to the hierarchy of the duo in the eyes of God, relationship comes first, and is appreciated most!</p>
		  	<p>Jesus elaborated a situation of us having to sow a seed, yet remembering that a brother or sister has got a grudge against us. In this situation He clearly states, “Dump your gift at the altar, go and reconcile first.” In essence, the magnitude of your gift doesn’t matter when the brotherly relationship is lacking. This is what God meant. When there is no love, let there be no gift. Your seed is only valued, when your relationship with others is good.</p>
		  	<p>How can we claim to love and give to God whom we cannot optically see, when we don’t love and give to those who are physically with us? As I began to think and ponder on this, I saw something deeper and more revealing than that, which even swept me off my feet. I marveled over this particular line of this scripture.</p>
		  	<p><i>And there remember that your brother or sister has something against you,</i></p>
		  	<p>Did you notice that God didn’t speak about you bearing a grudge against your brother, but, your brother bearing a grudge against you? In essence, you may not necessarily have anything against your brother; you may not be the one who is crossed with your brother; but the mere fact that you are knowledgeable of the grudge your brother has against you, calls for instant reconciliation.</p>
		  	<p>At that juncture, nothing else coming from you matters to God. Not gold. Not silver. No matter the quantity and quality of goods and services you have to offer; I’ve got to tell you this. Drop it and reconcile first! This passage simply portrays the truth that in Kingdom ranking, Relationship comes before seed.</p>
		  	<p>The bible says that we should be in love with our enemies. That’s what makes us different as Sons of God. Love! Not just love, but having to love someone whom you know wants the worst of you. Tax collectors love; yes! But only their friends. Pagans love as well, but their love is limited to just friends. The only difference you have to show as a Son of God is to love beyond limits and restrictions whatsoever. For in the sight of God, love and relationship is of more value than the seed (offering) you have to sow.</p>
		  	<p>I am yet to meet someone that I don’t love. There is no one I cannot love! I’ve got the love of God in me! Operate with this mindset today. Remain blessed!</p>
