		  	<p><i>But the Egyptians pursued after them, all the horses and chariots of Pharaoh, and his horsemen, and his army, and overtook them encamping by the sea, beside Pihahiroth, before Baalzephon.</i></p>
		  	<p><i>And when Pharaoh drew nigh, the children of Israel lifted up their eyes, and, behold, the Egyptians marched after them; and they were sore afraid: and the children of Israel cried out unto the Lord. (Exodus 14:9-10)</i></p>

		  	<blockquote>There is no dead-end situation, beyond God’s ability to redeem. He is the water we get in the desert; He is the way we find in the wilderness. </blockquote>

		  	<p>I can imagine the thoughts that went through the heart of Moses and the Israelites. They thought that they were finally free from the grip of the Egyptians, but in no time, they were caught between the Egyptians and the red sea.</p>
		  	<p>It was indeed a dead end! They thought: “If we go forward to the sea, it shall swallow us up; and if we go back to the Egyptians, there shall be great trouble, and perhaps death.”</p>
		  	<p>Have you ever approached a juncture in life that seemed like a dead end; a place that poses danger all around you? A season when you cannot return to your past, neither can you move forward; you are drowning in your challenges, seeking a possible way of escape, but finding none.</p>
		  	<p>Beloved, even in such a season, God remains the only way out. The Israelites had declared their case a dead end, but God made a way out of it. God will turn around the dead-end situations in your life, to His glory.</p>
		  	<p>Here’s another dead-end situation, through which the Lord was glorified.</p>
		  	<p><i>If we say, We will enter into the city, then the famine is in the city, and we shall die there: and if we sit still here, we die also. Now therefore come, and let us fall unto the host of the Syrians: if they save us alive, we shall live; and if they kill us, we shall but die. (2 Kings 7:4)</i></p>
		  	<p>The lepers, who sat at the gate in a time of intense famine, were threatened by death in all ways. If they had returned to their city, from whence they had been rejected, they would have died; if they had remained where they were, they would have still died; but God used them to fulfil His Word spoken through the Prophet, Elisha.</p>
		  	<p>Out of their dead-end situation, God made a miracle, which blessed the entire city.</p>
		  	<p>Hagar and her son also encountered a dead-end situation. They had been driven out by Sarah, and so could not return; they had run out of water in the wilderness, and could no longer proceed. She had almost given up to death, when she just decided to call on God, and He opened her eyes to a well of water behind her. (Genesis 21:14-19)</p>
		  	<p>Beloved, there is no dead end situation, beyond God’s ability to redeem. What then should you do when you approach a dead end situation? Recognize that God remains the way, even in dead-end situations.</p>
		  	<p>He is the water we get in the desert; He is the way we find in the wilderness. There is no dead-end situation as long as God is concerned.</p>
		  	<p>Never listen to the deceit of the enemy. When you have risen up from your past, and you’re gradually approaching the future, the enemy might try to deceive you into believing that your future bears danger in it; but understand that your best days are never in the past—it’s ahead of you.</p>
		  	<p>Notice the Israelites always condemned Moses for liberating them; this is because they were deceived into thinking that their best days were behind them (in serving the Egyptians), thus, they could not recognize the promise land ahead.</p>
		  	<p>Beloved, your best days are not behind you, there is a promise land. Even when you seem to have approached a dead-end, don’t turn back. Trust God to lead you safely into your destiny. The best is yet to come. Be blessed!</p>
