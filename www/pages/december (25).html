		  	<p><i>And God saw every thing that he had made, and, behold, it was very good. And the evening and the morning were the sixth day. (Genesis 1:31)</i></p>
		  	

		  	<blockquote>Before you receive the judgments and opinions of others, be sure to have a concrete judgment based on God’s Word.</blockquote>

		  	<p>From the beginning of creation, God always spoke things into existence that were not, and He saw everything as being good.</p>
		  	<p>When the earth was dark, void and formless, he spoke light, shape and inhabitation. For every element that was created, God saw the good in it, before He proceeded to create something new.</p>
		  	<p>When He said, “let there be light”, and there was light, the next thing that happened was that He saw that the light was good, and began to create something new.</p>
		  	<p>God was the first to appreciate what He created. He made conclusions positively, and not based on the opinion of anyone. The amazing thing is, everything He saw as being good, and called good actually became good.</p>
		  	<p>Today, as we appreciate nature, one thing we bear in mind is that God appreciated it first, when He saw that it was good.</p>
		  	<p>Here’s the point, you don’t need anyone to appreciate you before you value yourself; people see you just the way you see yourself. If God created the earth without seeing any good in it, no other person would have probably seen it as being good.</p>
		  	<p>Don’t value yourself based on the opinion of people; instead, view yourself from God’s perspective. God created you and saw that you were good; no other person has the right to tell you that you are not good enough.</p>
		  	<p>God created light and saw that it was good. He created the animals and saw that it was good. He created the firmament and saw that it was good. For everything He created, He first recognized the good in it. If you don’t recognize your worth, no one else will.</p>
		  	<p>Just as the creation is the way God sees it (good); you are just the way you see yourself. Before God could give anyone the opportunity to judge His creation, He first judged it.</p>
		  	<p>Before you receive the judgments and opinions of others, be sure to have a concrete judgment based on God’s Word. You are not what the world sees you as, you are who God sees you as; if God saw you as being good right from the day He created you, then you cannot be anything less than good.</p>
		  	<p>The world saw David as being an underage folk, who lacked experience in battles; but God looked beyond the outward appearance, chose him as the king and enabled him to defeat Goliath. David never saw himself the way the world saw him, He viewed himself from the eyes of God.</p>
		  	<p>You are just the way you see yourself; if you see yourself the way the world sees you, you’d remain limited in every way. Likewise, if you see yourself the way God sees you, nothing will be impossible for you to accomplish.</p>
		  	<p>The situation is what you say it is; you are how you see yourself. Learn to value yourself, and understand your worth. Be blessed!</p>
