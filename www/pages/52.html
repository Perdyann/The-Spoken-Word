		  	<p><i>And thy righteousness shall go before thee; the glory of the Lord shall be thy reward. (Isaiah 58:8)</i></p>
		  	


		  	<blockquote>A companion that is not worth presenting to God is not worth having. </blockquote>

		  	<p>If there’s one thing that could transform a state beyond recognition, it is the glory of God. It is infeasible to find a man who has had God’s glory upon him, and remained unchanged. The glory of God announces a man.</p>
		  	<p>David would not have been able to defeat Goliath of his own strength and ability, but when the glory of God came upon him, the death of Goliath was made history.</p>
		  	<p>Serverally, we may have been in the place of prayer, but it had no effect; However, when the glory of the Lord clouds an atmosphere, we can sense the effects of our prayers even before we speak.</p>
		  	<p>When the glory of the Lord is at work, natural protocols are broken, divine promotions take place, healing saturates the atmosphere, the impossible is commonly encountered.</p>
		  	<p>I am yet to encounter a situation where righteousness leads a man or nation, and God’s glory does not back it up. Righteousness exalts a nation (Proverbs 13:34).</p>
		  	<p>Righteousness is the nature we have received from God that gives us a right standing in His presence, that is, standing in the presence of God without any feeling of guilt, inferiority or condemnation. It is the rightness of God in the human spirit.</p>
		  	<p>From the moment we got born-again, we gave up the human nature, and received God’s own nature. However, this righteousness, which we have received in our spirit, needs to find expression outwardly. Our words, actions and charisma should reflect righteousness.</p>
		  	<p>I often say, “The Saul, who persecuted the church is not the same as the Paul who wrote most of the books of the new testament.” Saul lacked righteousness. he was blind spiritually. However, from the moment he encountered the glory of God at Damascus, there was a vast transformation.</p>
		  	<p>Beloved, whatsoever ye do, ensure it is done with the glory of God. Never move or act outside the glory of God. Be like Moses who said, <i> “If your presence will not go with me, do not bring us up from here” (Exodus 33:15) </i> for anything done outside God is void.</p>
		  	<p>Righteousness is that key that releases the glory of God upon a man. Anything or any company that keeps you ashamed of God’s presence should be gotten rid of. A companion that is not worth presenting to God is not worth having.</p>
		  	<p>As we decide to always walk in the will of God, and in Righteousness, we are overshadowed by the glory of God, which exalts us from being just average, and sets us apart for greatness. Be blessed!</p>
