		  	<p><i>And Ruth the Moabitess said unto Naomi, Let me now go to the field, and glean ears of corn after him in whose sight I shall find grace. And she said unto her, Go, my daughter. Then said Boaz unto his servant that was set over the reapers, Whose damsel is this? (Ruth 2:2 & 5)</i></p>

		  	<blockquote>We are more ready for a spouse when we are not in search of them. We should meet our spouse within the concise of our purpose and Divine assignment.</blockquote>

		  	<p>Ruth left her abode that morning, with the intention of gathering grains in the grain-field. She went out, not in search of a new husband, but in search of grains. She settled for hard work, and in the process of work, there was a divine connection - She met her soul-mate!</p>
		  	<p>Beloved, just like Ruth, don’t be too focused on your search for a soul-mate, that you neglect the work of God. Your soul-mate should meet you in the place of work. Your soul-mate is a blessing God gives to you in your place of work, when He perceives that there is a need for two parties to complement each-other, so that the work of God will be enhanced.</p>
		  	<p>There are many things we should understand about relationships and marriage. It is sacred! We are more ready for a spouse when we are not in search of them. We should meet our spouse within the concise of our purpose and Divine assignment. God knows when we need a spouse, much more than we do.</p>
		  	<p>It was not Adam that was desperate for a wife. He was not the one who suggested his need for a wife to God.</p>
		  	<p>Beloved, God has a time. The bible says, <i> “ ... no good thing will he withhold from them that walk uprightly.” (Psalm 84:11) </i> If God has withheld that soul-mate from you, then it either, the soul-mate is not what you need at that time, or you are not walking uprightly. Ruth walked uprightly in her grain field, and so did Adam, in the garden, which he nurtured.</p>
		  	<p>When God saw that Adam was in the place of work, in the presence of God, and with the Word of God; and when He perceived that it was time for him to be complemented, he made a woman out of him.</p>
		  	<p>Ruth was in the grain-field, and Adam was in the garden, likewise, it is important for us to be in the presence of God, in the place of work (assignment & purpose), and enriched with the Word of God, before we think of being connected to a soul-mate.</p>
		  	<p>God only said that it is not good for man to be alone, when Adam had met all these criteria. In essence,—If he doesn’t have the presence of God, work, or the Word, then it is good for him to be alone—Myles Munroe</p>
		  	<p>Furthermore, we must understand that there is a Divine timing, which differs from the natural. Naturally, a lot of people tend to get married, within a certain age limit, say 21-30. Verily, this age limit is not what determines God’s time for you.</p>
		  	<p>Praise George said, “Maturity is not a function of biological age. What determines your level of maturity is the investment of positive life-transforming information you’ve made in yourself.”</p>
		  	<p>Above all, much more than we are engrossed in a search of a soul mate, we should prioritize the Work of God.—Our destiny in God is higher than marriage — Praise George.</p>
		  	<p>God will get you connected in the process of your assignment, and in the right time. Focus on Him more than anything else... Be blessed!</p>
