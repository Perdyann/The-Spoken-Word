		  	<p><i>And to him they agreed: and when they had called the apostles, and beaten them, they commanded that they should not speak in the name of Jesus, and let them go.</i></p>
		  	<p><i>And they departed from the presence of the council, rejoicing that they were counted worthy to suffer shame for his name. (Acts 5:40-41)</i></p>

		  	<blockquote>The height of your trial is a revelation of how worthy you are. Rejoice!</blockquote>

		  	<p>To what extent are you willing and ready to be tried for His Name? Persecution might be a shameful phase, but when it is faced for the sake and Name of Our Lord, then it is a joyous phase.</p>
		  	<p>After the Apostles had been flogged, battered and bruised, just after they had been warned and threatened; everyone expected them to be saddened, weary and discouraged. That was not the case.</p>
		  	<p>They had a different perspective of life; they didn’t regard their persecution as a shameful thing, but as an honorable one. They were more honored by tribulations than they were shamed by it.</p>
		  	<p>Verily, not everyone on the street is flogged for the sake of the gospel; not everyone is persecuted for the gospel; not everyone is imprisoned for the gospel; but a few, who have gone an extra-mile to ensure that the gospel is preached in all the surface of the earth. It is an honor to be counted worthy to be among those few. It is written:</p>
		  	<p><i>If ye were of the world, the world would love his own: but because ye are not of the world, but I have chosen you out of the world, therefore the world hateth you. (John 15:19)</i></p>
		  	<p>This scripture portrays that the hatred and persecutions we face, is as a result of us being chosen by God out of the world. In essence, persecution is a proof that we are honored and chosen; why then should we regard it as shameful and not honorable?</p>
		  	<p>In fact, not being persecuted is a case to be concerned about. If you are not persecuted and tried, you’re probably of the world.</p>
		  	<p>Therefore, count it all joy when you go through adverse trials (James 1:2). Our attitude towards trials should be that of joy and not shame.</p>
		  	<p>The enemy wouldn’t bother tempting his own; he wouldn’t bother throwing stones at fruitless trees; he wouldn’t bother persecuting people that lack potentials and gifts; he wouldn’t bother fighting against someone, who is not a threat to him.</p>
		  	<p>For you to have been persecuted, and tried, it means that there is something valuable in you. The height of your trial is a revelation of how worthy you are. Rejoice!</p>
		  	<p>There is joy in being persecuted; there is joy in being tried; there is joy in being chained, battered and bruised for the gospel; these very things reveal our greatness. Be blessed!</p>
