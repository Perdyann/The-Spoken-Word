		  	<p><i>Let your conversation be without covetousness; and be content with such things as ye have: for he hath said, I will never leave thee, nor forsake thee.</i></p>
		  	<p><i>So that we may boldly say, The Lord is my helper, and I will not fear what man shall do unto me. (Hebrews 13:5-6)</i></p>

		  	<blockquote>Many men are willing to celebrate with you in times of merry, not many are willing to carry your burden at tough times.</blockquote>

		  	<p>Beloved, our confidence, not to be afraid in the midst of frightening situations, and to feel secure in the midst of hazardous circumstances, rests in this very Word, and promise of God, “I will never leave thee, nor forsake thee.”</p>
		  	<p>As a result of this spoken Word of God, we are confident enough to declare our faith in God.</p>
		  	<p>I have experienced seasons when situations seemed to be working against me, and at some other point, lines just fell in pleasant places for me. In the latter case, many clung unto me, I felt loved and accompanied, and so I trusted and confided in some of them.</p>
		  	<p>However, in the former case, when the table had turned around, isolation was the great ordeal I had to face, because, even my confidants treated me like a plague.</p>
		  	<p>A blend of these circumstances propelled me to reach a conclusion that a sure friend is only known in times of difficulties. At that juncture, I embraced the saying, “A friend in need is a friend indeed.”</p>
		  	<p>TD Jakes once said, “If you want to know who a man really is, watch how he treats people, whom he think he does not need.”</p>
		  	<p>Who can find that friend who will be willing to walk with you through the pit, and the palace? Where is that friend that remains genuine through thick and thin?</p>
		  	<p>It is important to know that Joseph was forsaken and cast into a pit by his presumed confidants (brothers), but by the time he got to the palace, these same traitors came looking for him. The season of the pit signifies a time to be forsaken by men, whereas, the season of the palace signifies a time to be searched for by all.</p>
		  	<p>I have been in the pit, and searched for all, whom I once confided in... I cried with a loud voice, but no one responded. In the midst of such an ordeal, I heard the still small voice of the Lord Whisper, “I am here, and have always been... Have I not said to thee, I will never leave you nor forsake you no matter the situation?” (Deuteronomy 31:6)</p>
		  	<p>Again He assured me saying, <i> “Hearken unto me, O house of Jacob, and all the remnant of the house of Israel, which are borne by me from the belly, which are carried from the womb: </i></p>
		  	<p><i>And even to your old age I am he; and even to hoar hairs will I carry you: I have made, and I will bear; even I will carry, and will deliver you.” (Isaiah 46:3-4)</i></p>
		  	<p>Beloved, where else can we find such love? Men will always fail, that’s why they are men. God never fails! Even my Brethren and Fathers in the Lord have walked away from me when I thought I needed them most.</p>
		  	<p>When I went through trying situations, only God abode with me, and comforted me. Many men are willing to celebrate with you in times of merry, not many are willing to carry your burden at tough times. But God, in His Word, has assured us thus <i> — I have made, and I will bear; even I will carry, and will deliver you. - </i></p>
		  	<p>My strength is in my faith, that I am never alone! I have indeed walked in fire, but was not burned. I have walked on water, but was not drowned. I have been casted by men into the Lion’s den, but was not harmed. God lives in me!</p>
		  	<p>God never walks away, even in times of our weaknesses. I always thought that God could leave me because of my weakness, but then I realized that the reverse is the case. Since it is darkness that leaves a room at the presence of light, then it must be my weaknesses that are expelled because of the presence of God in me. God’s strength is made perfect, even in our weaknesses. (2 Corinthians 12:9)</p>
		  	<p>Beloved, never let anything rip you off this consciousness—God never walks away . . . When all else is gone, He remains the last one standing with you!—Stop seeking trust in men; there is no better place to find rest, than in the arms of God. Be blessed!</p>
