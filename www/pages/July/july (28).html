		  	<p><i>And many charged him that he should hold his peace: but he cried the more a great deal, Thou son of David, have mercy on me. (Mark 10:48)</i></p>

		  	<blockquote>If you are still concerned about protocols, you will miss many divinely orchestrated opportunities. </blockquote>

		  	<p>Bartimaeus was a blind man, who sat by the highway begging. One day, as Jesus journeyed out of Jericho with His disciples, Bartimaeus obviously couldn’t see anything happening, but he heard that Jesus was passing by.</p>
		  	<p>He had heard so much about the miracles performed by Jesus, and I presume that he must have longed to meet Jesus. His only dream would have been to meet that man, who was capable of making him whole.</p>
		  	<p>The only desire of his heart must have been a personal encounter with Jesus. He had heard of the testimonies of many people, and constantly hoped for his own miracle.</p>
		  	<p>As Jesus passed through Jericho, Bartimaeus felt like his long awaited dream had finally come to pass. There was no way he was going to miss out on that opportunity. He felt it so strong in his heart that his time had come, and he was determined not to let anything or anyone hinder him from receiving from the master.</p>
		  	<p>He desired sight so much that nothing else mattered to him; at that point, the word protocol ceased to exist in his vocabulary and mind.</p>
		  	<p>The more they tried to calm him, the louder he cried; the more they persuaded him to observe the right protocols, the less of a concern it was to him. He did not care about what people said. He was not concerned about those mocking him. He was not bothered about his environment. He was not thinking of his reputation. Indeed, he cried a great deal, not minding protocols.</p>
		  	<p>Here’s the point, when you desire something so much; when you sight a Divine opportunity; when you know that your time has finally come; you will cease to be concerned about your environment, and its protocols.</p>
		  	<p>When the woman with the issue of blood sighted her healing in the garment of Jesus, she ceased to be concerned about her environment; she denied her reputation, casted off her mind, the words of everyone else, and pushed till she grasped her healing.</p>
		  	<p>I believe that as she pushed through the crowd to touch Jesus, people must have calmed her down, just as they tried to calm Bartimaeus down. People must have persuaded her to observe the queuing protocol. But she acted in faith, not minding protocols.</p>
		  	<p>If you are still concerned about what people will say, then you are not ready to get a hold of your desire. If you are still concerned about protocols, you will miss many divinely orchestrated opportunities.</p>
		  	<p>When it is your time to receive, not even protocols can stand in your way. Forget about the protocols, and receive your promise. Be blessed!</p>
