		  	<p><i>And cast him out of the city, and stoned him: and the witnesses laid down their clothes at a young man’s feet, whose name was Saul.</i></p>
		  	<p><i>And they stoned Stephen, calling upon God, and saying, Lord Jesus, receive my spirit.</i></p>
		  	<p><i>And he kneeled down, and cried with a loud voice, Lord, lay not this sin to their charge. And when he had said this, he fell asleep. (Acts 7:58-60)</i></p>

		  	<blockquote>The people, who fight against your vision today, might be the same people God will use to fulfil Divine mandates tomorrow. We have no justification to withhold love. </blockquote>

		  	<p>There are so many great things to learn from the life of Stephen; even at the point of death, he still showed love to his enemies.</p>
		  	<p>Being stoned to death is one of the most painful experiences; you can imagine the manner of excruciating pains that was felt by Stephen.</p>
		  	<p>At such state, the most appropriate thing to do must have been to lay curses on his persecutors; as the servant of God, he could have easily cursed their entire generation; he could have prayed God to repay and punish them for their sins and iniquities, but that was not the case.</p>
		  	<p>He uttered a prayer of love; he prayed that God will not hold their sins against them.</p>
		  	<p>How many people will have the courage to do that? That is a perfect illustration of loving your enemies; his desire was not to have his persecutors perish, but to have their souls saved.</p>
		  	<p>When unbelievers err against us, we sometimes wish that they will pay dearly for their actions, but how often do we pray for their salvation? How often do we pray that the sins of our enemies be not counted against them?</p>
		  	<p>Stephen did not die, but he fell asleep; the righteous don’t die, they sleep. He did not give up the ghost as a result of the pains he felt, but he rested peacefully in the arms of God.</p>
		  	<p>It is also remarkable to note that Saul was one of the fellows, who held the garments of the murderers of Stephen. In essence, he was directly or indirectly linked to the death of Stephen.</p>
		  	<p>If Stephen chose to curse everyone that had a hand in his death, Saul would not have been an exception; but as he rather prayed that their sins be forgiven them, and wished salvation to their souls, Saul was set apart for greater use by God.</p>
		  	<p>After the conversion of Saul, he did great things! He wrote most of the books of the New Testament, and God used him mightily.</p>
		  	<p>If Stephen could pray good for his persecutors despite all they did to him; if God could use Saul despite all his efforts to persecute the church; there is no reason why we shouldn’t love anyone.</p>
		  	<p>The people, who fight against your vision today, might be the same people God will use to fulfil Divine mandates tomorrow. We have no justification to withhold love.</p>
		  	<p>Don’t hate them because they have hated you; say a prayer of love and salvation, even for those who wish you evil.</p>
		  	<p>If Stephen could love his enemies at the point of death, then our love should also know no bounds. Be blessed!</p>
