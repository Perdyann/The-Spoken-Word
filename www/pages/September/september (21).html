		  	<p><i>But godliness with contentment is great gain. For we brought nothing into this world, and it is certain we can carry nothing out.</i></p>
		  	<p><i>And having food and raiment let us be therewith content (1Timothy 6:6-8)</i></p>
		 

		  	<blockquote>A great ambition might boost your social status, but can never increase your spiritual stand.</blockquote>

		  	<p>Paul, in his letter to Timothy attests to the certainty of this truth—we have brought nothing to the world, and we can carry nothing out of it. To a large extent, this particularly brings to our consciousness the vanity of every earthly treasure.</p>
		  	<p>Of what use is it that we are endlessly caught up in the pursuit of worldly agendas? What becomes of our ambition when we are no more?</p>
		  	<p>Academic degrees, social reputation, political ambition, and economic assets last only for a lifetime. It is good to have all these, but very erroneous to focus on them.</p>
		  	<p>Seeing then that all these, although very good and beneficial, are also temporal, it is obvious that there is no point compromising to attain any of them.</p>
		  	<p>The petty gains that have made us to compromise will not leave with us when we depart tomorrow; the ambitions we so dearly seek will be nothing tomorrow; the estates we have labored to build will be for another to possess tomorrow; the jobs, which we have told lies to get will not be ours’ tomorrow.</p>
		  	<p>The world is passing away with everything in it. What we consider constant today will be defined as variable by tomorrow.</p>
		  	<p>Having a full knowledge of this, let us add to our godliness, contentment; for this is great gain.</p>
		  	<p>Set your priorities right; let eternal treasures be valued above vainglory; any treasure that cannot outlive time is not worth compromising for.</p>
		  	<p>As much as I hate mediocrity, as much as I hate living an ordinary life, as much as I am dissatisfied with anything average; I don’t attribute any value to vanity.</p>
		  	<p>A great ambition might boost your social status, but can never increase your spiritual stand. Good academic degrees might grant you access to reputable places, but can never give you access to the kingdom of God.</p>
		  	<p>All earthly treasures are good for a lifetime, but our consciousness outlasts our earthly lifetime. Seek therefore that, which lasts through eternity. Be blessed!</p>
