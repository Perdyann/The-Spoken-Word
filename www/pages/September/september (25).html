		  	<p><i>Then his lord, after that he had called him, said unto him, O thou wicked servant, I forgave thee all that debt, because thou desiredst me:</i></p>
		  	<p><i>Shouldest not thou also have had compassion on thy fellowservant, even as I had pity on thee?</i></p>
		  	<p><i>And his lord was wroth, and delivered him to the tormentors, till he should pay all that was due unto him. (Matthew 18:32-34)</i></p>
	

		  	<blockquote>Mercy can be withdrawn when it is withheld; when you withhold mercy from your neighbors, the mercy, which you have received, is withdrawn </blockquote>

		  	<p>Mercy, which has already been released, can easily be withdrawn by a merciless act.</p>
		  	<p>Here’s a situation, whereby, a certain servant, who owed so much had been forgiven, and his debts cleared by mercy. It happened that he also had a debtor, who owed him not more than a tenth of what he previously owed.</p>
		  	<p>However, he blatantly refused to be merciful to his debtor. Due to his merciless act, the mercy which was already released to him was withdrawn.</p>
		  	<p>He had already been forgiven, his debts had already been cleared, and he was already a free man; however, because he lacked compassion and mercy, that, which was given unto him was withdrawn.</p>
		  	<p>Verily, many men have withheld and withdrawn their blessings as a result of their unforgiving hearts. People, who have been freed already, have ushered themselves back to the realm of captivity, as a result of unforgiveness.</p>
		  	<p>Mercy can be withdrawn when it is withheld; when you deliberately withhold mercy from your neighbors, the mercy, which you have received, is withdrawn.</p>
		  	<p>Little wonder the Lord’s Prayer states that we should be forgiven our trespasses in accordance with how we have forgiven our trespassers. In essence, if we have withheld mercy from our trespassers, we are not qualified to receive mercy from the Lord.</p>
		  	<p>What the servant in the scripture was owed is nothing compared to the debt, for which he had been cleared by mercy. Even so, he was unwilling to extend the mercy he received to his brethren.</p>
		  	<p>His master had done great things for him, yet, he chose to be careless in dealing with his subjects. This led to a withdrawal of the Masters mercy. Carelessness can undo great deeds.</p>
		  	<p>Even when I am very exasperated by the actions of those around me, I choose not to withhold mercy. I do this not for their sake, but for my own good.</p>
		  	<p>The height of atrocities that I have committed, for which God never withheld mercy, is too much to be compared to the worst anyone can do to me.</p>
		  	<p>Beloved, if God can forgive us, despite how abominable our deeds might have been, we have not right whatsoever to withhold mercy. Bear in mind — by constantly withholding mercy from your neighbors’, you are silencing and withdrawing God’s mercy on your life. Be blessed!</p>
