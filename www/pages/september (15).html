		  	<p><i>For he was [waiting expectantly and confidently] looking forward to the city which has fixed and firm foundations, whose Architect and Builder is God. (Hebrews 11:10 AMP)</i></p>
		  

		  	<blockquote>Any building that lacks a solid foundation in God is not worth dwelling in. </blockquote>

		  	<p>After God had given Abraham a promise, he was not just waiting to possess any city, but particularly, a city founded, planned and built by God. He had a standard, and was not moved by anything contrary to that.</p>
		  	<p>This was quite unlike Lot; he made a choice, not on the basis of the city having a strong foundation, but on the sight of a well watered city, that seemed to have great prospects. He was carried away by the look of the land; not minding how established in God, the foundation was.</p>
		  	<p>Abraham’s actions were always prompted by the standard he set, in line with the promise of God. He was not enticed by the seeming prospects of any land, but by the strength of its foundation.</p>
		  	<p>Just like Abraham, we should not get carried away by the design of the covers of any book, but intentionally seek to know the foundation and content of it.</p>
		  	<p>Do not be led by your senses (sight) like Lot was; rather, be moved by the Word of God.</p>
		  	<p>Embrace the standard of Abraham; no matter how pleasant anything looks, if it does not have a strong foundation, and if it is not established by God, then it is not worth having.</p>
		  	<p>Any building that lacks a solid foundation in God is not worth dwelling in.</p>
		  	<p>A strong foundation and an establishment by God is what makes any city, project, idea, or vision desirable. Don’t get involved in a project without understanding its foundation. Don’t get involved in the development of any idea that is not established by God.</p>
		  	<p>If we want to receive the great promises of God in our lives, we must be very discerning. Not every offer and opportunity is of God; some ideas that are well packaged and sugar-coated are not established by God.</p>
		  	<p>Wait patiently for the genuine promise, and do not be carried away by counterfeit ideas.</p>
		  	<p>Abraham waited expectantly and confidently, on the fulfillment of God’s Word in his life. In the same way, we must be expectant and confident.</p>
		  	<p>As you wait in all expectation, that city founded by God will be yours’ to possess in no time. Be blessed!</p>
