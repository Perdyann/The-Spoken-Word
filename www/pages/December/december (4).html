		  	<p><i>So now faith, hope, and love abide, these three; but the greatest of these is love. (1 Corinthians 13:13 ESV)</i></p>
		  

		  	<blockquote>The effectiveness of faith is propelled by love. The height of your faith, without love equals nullity. </blockquote>

		  	<p>Faith, hope and love are the three-fold chord, which are interrelated. However, the scripture makes us to understand that there is a ranking amongst them all. They are all great virtues that yield a harmonious Christian life, but love is the greatest of all.</p>
		  	<p>There can be no faith when there is no hope; in the same vein, faith and hope cannot amount to anything without love. Do you know that a prayer of love heals the sick better than the prayer of faith? This is because faith has no effect without love. It is written:</p>
		  	<p><i>When he went ashore he saw a great crowd, and he had compassion on them and healed their sick. (Matthew 14:14 ESV)</i></p>
		  	<p>Quite a lot of the miracles Jesus wrought were propelled by His compassion and love for the people. Jesus could have sent the five thousand away to get food for themselves, but His love for them birthed a miracle of multiplication.</p>
		  	<p>There are people, who did not deserve to be healed, but He healed them; there are people whose faith did not qualify them to receive healing, but they did. Why? Compassion and love!</p>
		  	<p>The man who was at the pool for as long as thirty eight years did not have faith, instead, he was filled with complains. Jesus asked him if he wanted to be healed, and he never responded positively, instead, he responded in complains and bitterness. (John 5:5-8) Why did Jesus still heal him? Faith? Not exactly; Love!</p>
		  	<p>I can have so much faith in my anointing and pray for the sick, but if really, I don’t have compassion and love for them, my prayer cannot be effective. The effectiveness of faith is propelled by love. Little wonder the scriptures says,</p>
		  	<p><i>And if I have prophetic powers, and understand all mysteries and all knowledge, and if I have all faith, so as to remove mountains, but have not love, I am nothing. (1 Corinthians 13:2)</i></p>
		  	<p>Do you recall when Jesus told His disciples that by faith, they can move mountains? Well this scripture goes further to state that even when you have such faith, but lack love, you are nothing.</p>
		  	<p>The height of your faith, without love equals nullity. There is no point having such great faith without love, it is as good as dead. A man who has great faith without love is no different from a man who has no faith at all.</p>
		  	<p>Without hope, you really can’t have faith; and faith without love is nothing! Faith is great, and so is hope and love. However, amongst these, the greatest is love.</p>
		  	<p>You might be the most Prophetic Minister in town; you might be the one, who fasts and prays the most; you might be the most gifted and renowned. However, your real strength and tenacity is only proven by love.</p>
		  	<p>How affectionate are you towards the needs of others; how concerned are you about the affairs of your neighbor? The lawyer asked Jesus what the greatest commandment is, and He said love! You might not be a thief, murderer, or slot, but if you breach the commandment of love, you have failed.</p>
		  	<p>The rich man neglected the needs of Lazarus and ended up in hell. What was his crime? He breached the commandment of love!</p>
		  	<p>Love is how the Sons of God are identified (John 13:35); it is good to have faith and hope, but not good enough without love. Love is the greatest commandment of all time. Be blessed!</p>
