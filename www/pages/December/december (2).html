		  	<p><i>And Stephen, full of faith and power, did great wonders and miracles among the people. (Acts 6:8)</i></p>
		  	

		  	<blockquote>In order for great wonders and miracles to be manifest, there’s got to be an overflow of faith and power.</blockquote>

		  	<p>Stephen was full of faith and power, thus miracles had no choice than to occur. Beloved, when a man is full of faith and power, his life becomes a wonder.</p>
		  	<p>When Jesus spoke to the storm and it became calm, men marveled and said, “What manner of man is this? Even the storms obey Him.” Jesus walked on water, changed water to wine, fed a multitude with five loaves and fish, raised the dead, and the list goes on. He was so used to doing the impossible. His life was such a wonder!</p>
		  	<p>When Paul was bitten by a snake, everyone looked at him, expecting him to get swollen and die in no time; but instead, the snake died, and he lived without harm. This made everyone to marvel as they reached a conclusion that he was a god (Acts 28:3-6). The handkerchief of Paul was used to heal the sick, he casted out demons, and the list goes on. His life was such a wonder!</p>
		  	<p>Why do some men live ordinary lives, while the lives of some others are characterized by great wonders and miracles?</p>
		  	<p>I would not tell you that it is their calling to operate in wonders, no! As long as you are a Son of God, your life should be filled with great wonders; however, so many Sons are living like servants.</p>
		  	<p>Great wonders and miracles are not exclusively reserved for Pastors, Prophets, Apostles, Teachers and Evangelists. These are the rights of every Son of God, which is only propelled by great faith and power.</p>
		  	<p>The reason why Stephen, Jesus, Paul, and others walked in the miraculous is because they were full of faith and power. Notice the scripture does not say that Stephen had a measure of faith and power, no! Instead, it is quoted that he was full of faith and power, thus he did great wonders and miracles.</p>
		  	<p>God has dealt with every man a measure of faith, but Stephen did not just operate on that measure. He grew it! He became full of faith and power.</p>
		  	<p>In order for great wonders and miracles to be manifest, there’s got to be an overflow of faith and power. The reason why he was able to do all he did is because he was full of faith and power. He was not struggling to have faith, he was full of faith; he was not trying to have power, he was full of power.</p>
		  	<p>Beloved, what is the level of faith and power at work in you? That’s the determinant of the extent of your result. Great wonders and miracles are not propelled by fears, tears or struggles, but by full faith and power.</p>
		  	<p>The bible declares that God can do exceedingly abundantly above all that we can think or ask, but it is according to the power that worketh in us. (Ephesians 3:30)</p>
		  	<p>Even though God is able to do great things; it is according to the power that worketh in us. When you are full of faith and power, nothing remains impossible to you.</p>
		  	<p>Beloved, stir yourself in faith and power by constant prayers in the Holy Ghost, and meditation on the Word of God. Make faith confessions and declarations always; walk in the miraculous like Jesus did. Be blessed!</p>
