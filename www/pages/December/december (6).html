		  	<p><i>Whoever brings blessing will be enriched, and one who waters will himself be watered. (Proverbs 11:25 ERV)</i></p>
		  	

		  	<blockquote>The lessons we receive only lasts for a life-time, but the lessons we give outlives us.</blockquote>

		  	<p>When plants are dry, we water them to flourish; just in the same way we water the plants, we are also watered to flourish.</p>
		  	<p>The real color of a plant is only retained when it is constantly watered; a plant only continues to grow when it is constantly watered; a plant only flourishes when it is constantly watered.</p>
		  	<p>In the same way, when we are watered, our potentials are maximized, we experience growth and increase in every way, and we flourish and prosper.</p>
		  	<p>Many philosophers have taught people that in order to maximize their potentials, they should water and enrich themselves. In Christ, we receive revelations, which transcend philosophical facts. Verily beloved, if you want to maximize your own potential, start by watering and enriching the potential of your neighbors.</p>
		  	<p>When you teach people, you are not only doing them a favor, but yourself as well. One party might do the teaching, but both parties learn and benefit from it. What you learn from someone, you might forget; but that, which you teach someone, you can never forget.</p>
		  	<p>The lessons we receive only lasts for a life-time, but the lessons we give outlives us. When we help people discover their potentials, we are indirectly developing our own potential.</p>
		  	<p>If you want to flourish and prosper like the well-watered green plants, make room for others to flourish as well. When you are a blessing to someone, you are also blessed and enriched by God.</p>
		  	<p>Men, who are selfish in thought, never go far. The magnitude of your blessing is to a large extent determined by the degree of blessings you have brought. How watered you will be is determined by how well you have watered those around you.</p>
		  	<p>No one needs to die in order for you to live longer; stop trying to kill the dreams and visions of others, in a bid to fulfil yours. No one needs to go down, in order for you to step up; stop trying to belittle everyone else, in a bid to gain recognition for yourself.</p>
		  	<p>Invest in the lives of people, show them how much you appreciate them, recognize their unique gifts, talents and potentials and encourage your neighbors. Take advantage of every opportunity to lift one another up.</p>
		  	<p>By so doing, we are storing up blessings in our barns, which will cause us to flourish in no time. Be blessed!</p>
