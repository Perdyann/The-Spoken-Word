		  <div class="panel-body" style="text-align:justify">


		  	<p><i>Wherefore God also hath highly exalted him, and given him a name which is above every name:</i></p>
		  	<p><i>That at the name of Jesus every knee should bow, of things in heaven, and things in earth, and things under the earth;</i></p>
		  	<p><i>And that every tongue should confess that Jesus Christ is Lord, to the glory of God the Father. (Philippians 2:9-11)</i></p>
		  	

		  	<blockquote>That which the armor of Goliath could not do for him, the name of the Lord did for David. Physical weapons are not enough to tackle spiritual battles</blockquote>

		  	<p>There is a name greater than all other names; at the mention of this name, every knee must bow, and every tongue shall confess. Usually, when we read this scripture, the image we envisage is that of a physical knee.</p>
		  	<p>There is more to that; Knee represents limitations of all kinds, ranging, physical impairment, financial crises, marital disorder and even stagnancy.</p>
		  	<p>The name of Jesus is a name that puts all the elemental spirits of the world into subjection. There is no limitation, to which the name of the Lord is pronounced, that remains standing.</p>
		  	<p>David said to Goliath, that the latter had come to battle him with physical swords and weapons, but he (the former), had come with nothing but the name of the Lord. We all can attest to the winner of that battle.</p>
		  	<p>That which the armor of Goliath could not do for him, the name of the Lord did for David. Physical weapons are not enough to tackle spiritual battles; the name of the Lord is the only weapon you need to be guaranteed success in every sphere.</p>
		  	<p>Beloved, again when Peter met the lame man at the beautiful gate, he told him that he had not silver nor gold to offer, but only one thing, which is authority in the name of Jesus. Peter commanded him to rise up and walk in the name of Jesus, and it was so (Acts 3:6). That which many treasures could not offer, the name of the Lord granted to that man.</p>
		  	<p>Peter did not pray for that man, all he did was to use the name of Jesus as an instrument to heal him. It is obvious that there is no knee that remains standing at the mention of that name, Jesus.</p>
		  	<p>Paralysis gives way; cancer bows; AIDS flees; lack becomes surplus; mistakes are transformed to miracles; problems are turned to promises; shame is made fame... all at the mention of the name, Jesus.</p>
		  	<p>Beloved, who is that giant before you? Just like David, approach him with no weapon, but the name of Jesus. The solution to that problem is not silver and gold, but the name of Jesus.</p>
		  	<p>Exercise authority in the name of Jesus today, and watch all limitations give way. You are so blessed!</p>
