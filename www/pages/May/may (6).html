		  	<p><i>Then Peter said, Silver and gold have I none; but such as I have give I thee: In the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth rise up and walk. (Acts 3:6)</i></p>


		  	<blockquote>Peter released the Power of God upon the lame man in faith, but never ran short of the Power. When you give in faith, you don’t run out of resources, but get replenished.</blockquote>

		  	<p>Lots of silver and gold had been dropped into the lame man’s box; in as much as he valued all these treasures, you must realize that none of them was capable of changing his situation. For many years, he sat in front of that gate, and his condition never changed. All he ever needed to change him was the Power of the Holy Spirit, which answers to the name of Jesus. Peter said that he had not what the man desired, but indeed he had greater.</p>
		  	<p>When the lame man saw Peter and John, he was probably expecting money or treasures. When Peter mentioned, <i> “Silver and gold have I none”, </i> the lame man must have removed his attention from him because silver and gold was probably all he wanted.</p>
		  	<p>However, Peter had greater than the lame man’s wants; he had his needs. Sometimes, people don’t really know what they need.</p>
		  	<p>Considering the fact that the man was born lame, and had never known what it felt like to walk, he may have accepted lameness as his nature, and never expected to walk again. His focus was more on silver and gold, than it was on walking, because he had tagged it impossible.</p>
		  	<p>Everyone thought he needed silver and gold, but what he really needed was the Power of God. Among the millions of people that may have walked through the beautiful gate on a daily basis, only one person was able to recognize his real needs.</p>
		  	<p>Beloved, how observant have you been to recognize the needs of those around you. Are you like the fellows who merely passed through the gate, overlooking the lame man’s plight? Or will you like Peter, choose to give what you have, even if it’s not wanted?</p>
		  	<p>As I pondered deeply on this scripture, I realized that we all have something to give; we all have something someone needs. The problem is, we often fail to realize the needs of people around us, probably, because they are not directly related to us.</p>
		  	<p>O what a huge impact the world will feel if we all can make the decision to meet people at their points of need. God never blesses you for yourself. Whenever He blesses you, He will bring people around you, for you to bless. Many of us have shunned the souls God brought our way.</p>
		  	<p>Peter released the Power of God upon the lame man in faith, but never ran short of the Power. Verily, when you give in faith, you don’t run out of resources, but get replenished. The more you meet someone’s needs, the more you get replenished.</p>
		  	<p>Just like Peter, what you have to give may not be silver, gold or money; it may not be connections or talents. It might just be salvation, counsel, the Word of God, or an act of love.</p>
		  	<p>We encounter many lost souls daily; how many of them do we preach the gospel of salvation to? We meet depressed people daily; how many of them do we share God’s Word with? Our bank account is hardly below six digits, yet we refuse to meet the need of someone who is in financial crises.</p>
		  	<p>Beloved, it may seem like you really can’t help, but search deep within you, there is something God has deposited there, which the world is still groaning for. You have what it takes to change your world; be the impact your generation cries for. Be blessed!</p>
