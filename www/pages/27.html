		  	<p><i>Drive out the scoffer, and contention will go out; yes, strife and abuse will cease. (Proverbs 22:10)</i></p>
		  	


		  	<blockquote>Drop off any company that hinders your race... If you try to force them with you into destiny, they will force you out of your destiny. </blockquote>

		  	<p>I love this passage for one thing... We are not asked to convince the scoffers; we are not told to scold those who laugh at the truth; we are not told to plead with the scorners to be calm; it says, “Drive out!” In essence, they shouldn’t even be tolerated.</p>
		  	<p>This goes a long way to portray the fact that there are people in life who we just need to send away before we can move forward. The issue with a lot of people is the lack of courage! They try to convince people who are dragging them back to run up, they try to plead with people who bring about contention, strife and abuse to get calm. Sometimes, what is need is not just our tolerance, but our courage to say “get out!”</p>
		  	<p>The co-travelers tried to tolerate Jonah in the boat, but they realized that as long as Jonah was there, the storm was bound to abound, thus they couldn’t progress. They had to develop the courage to cast him out! (Jonah 1:15)</p>
		  	<p>Abraham tried to tolerate Lot and his herdsmen, but he realized that as long as they journeyed together, strife was bound to abound, he had to develop the courage to say, “Separate thyself from me.” (Genesis 13:9)</p>
		  	<p>Beloved, can’t you realize that as long as you try to tolerate and persuade the scoffers, contention, strife and abuse abounds? At some point, what’s needed most for progression is separation.</p>
		  	<p>I will never speak against tolerance, but one thing I must say is that we should be sensitive to know when the season to tolerate is over, and when it is time to separate. Sometimes, what God wants you to do is actually to set yourself apart, and not to try and cope. In some cases, the more you try to pull, the more arguing and shame persists. Drop off any company that hinders your race... If you try to force them with you into destiny, they will force you out of your destiny.</p>
		  	<p>Separation is a key-road to greatness. This is certain, “without separation, greatness may never come to be.” Moses had a purpose to fulfill in the land of Egypt, but he couldn’t do that while he was yet under Pharaoh’s roof. He had to separate for a while.</p>
		  	<p>Destinations are different; likewise we all have different purposes. Two people headed for different destinations can’t travel together, forever. Abraham couldn’t move with Lot, likewise, the sail men couldn’t move with Jonah. It is time to recognize those with whom you can’t move, and cast them out.</p>
		  	<p>Be in the trail that’s moving forward... In any nation you are, be the light and share the truth, but don’t expect everyone to listen to you because you weren’t sent to everyone. Scroll your life now, and be courageous enough to drive out any company that keeps you stagnant and doesn’t fuel your vision. Amen!</p>
