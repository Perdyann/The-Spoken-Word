		  	<p><i>And Saul arose from the earth; and when his eyes were opened, he saw no man: but they led him by the hand, and brought him into Damascus.</i></p>
		  	<p><i>And he was three days without sight, and neither did eat nor drink.</i></p>
		  	<p><i>And the Lord said unto him, Arise, and go into the street which is called Straight, and enquire in the house of Judas for one called Saul, of Tarsus: for, behold, he prayeth,</i></p>
		  	<p><i>And hath seen in a vision a man named Ananias coming in, and putting his hand on him, that he might receive his sight. (Acts 9:8-9 & 11-12)</i></p>

		  	<blockquote>More than I desire to see sight restored to a blind man, I desire to have him receive insight and soundness in his spirit. With a single insight to the Word of God, we can break through every physical limitation.</blockquote>

		  	<p>Of what use is it that a man is physically sound in sight, but visually impaired in the Spirit? Verily, the soundness of our physical senses is futile without spiritual insight.</p>
		  	<p>Saul was one of such kinds, having perfect sight, audition, and ability to speak; but he was a spiritual liability, being blind, deaf and mute to perceive any insight from the word of God.</p>
		  	<p>Saul’s encounter with God was indeed very significant, as it left him visually impaired for three days, but with an insight.</p>
		  	<p>Beloved, it is written, <i><b> and when his eyes were opened, he saw no man:</b></i></p>
		  	<p>Verily, when he opened his spiritual eyes, he saw nothing physically. Indeed, his spiritual eyes were opened by that encounter that left him visually impaired. Within those three days of physical darkness, he experienced the light of God.</p>
		  	<p>Furthermore, it is said, <i><b>And hath seen in a vision</b></i></p>
		  	<p>Saul couldn’t see a vision before. He had eyes, but could not receive insights. However, in those three days of visual impairment, he received a vision from God.</p>
		  	<p>Saul had always been a man of his physical senses. However, his encounter with God made him more of a man of revelation. He died to his self and senses, but resurrected with an insight.</p>
		  	<p>Ray Comfort once said—Better to be born blind and see the gospel than to be born with eyes and be blind to its truth.—Helen Keller was born blind and deaf, but saw and heard His voice through her ears and eyes of faith.</p>
		  	<p>Of what use are our physical senses, when we are not sensitive in the Spirit. Saul’s actions were previously prompted by what he saw, felt and perceived. However, when he became spiritually sensitive, he acted by revelation, and not mere feelings.</p>
		  	<p>Beloved, Helen Keller and Saul (in 3 days), are examples of people who were able to see light despite darkness; they received insight, despite their impairment.</p>
		  	<p>However, it is not the will of God that we are left physically impaired. Rather, it is His will that we have insights in Spirit.</p>
		  	<p>More than I desire to see sight restored to a blind man, I desire to have him receive insight and soundness in his spirit.</p>
		  	<p>Just like the case of Saul, it is possible for a man to be physically sound, but spiritually insensitive. However, it is impossible for a man to encounter the Word of God, in its fullness and remain impaired physically.</p>
		  	<p>Beloved, when the light of God burns from within you, it reflects on the outside. The spiritual controls the physical; thus our sensitivity and soundness in the Spirit could restore health to any physical deformity.</p>
		  	<p>The life of Helen Keller is such an inspiration; she never let her physical condition hinder her spiritual insight.</p>
		  	<p>Beloved, more than you groom your bodies to receive healing, groom your spirit to be sensitive and sound. With a single insight to the Word of God, we can break through every physical limitation. Be blessed!</p>
