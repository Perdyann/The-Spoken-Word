		  <div class="panel-body" style="text-align:justify">


		  	<p><i>And the inhabitant shall not say, I am sick: the people that dwell therein shall be forgiven their iniquity. (Isaiah 33:24)</i></p>

		  	<blockquote>The more we speak right, even when everything doesn’t seem right, the more our lives are aligned in the right course. </blockquote>

		  	<p>Some words have I deposited in my Spirit, and others have I banned from my vocabulary since I embraced the Higher Realm.</p>
		  	<p>Words that insinuate sickness, poverty, failure, fear, amongst others are long banned from my vocabulary. You can’t be a partaker of God’s Divine Nature, and still be using such words in description of yourself or situations.</p>
		  	<p>Those words are meant for ordinary men. Beloved, there is an average life, as well as the Higher Life. </p>
		  	<p>When the term “inhabitants” is used, it specifically portrays a realm. In essence, those who dwell in that realm are they, whose vocabulary prohibits the sentence, “I am sick.” It is written:</p>
		  	<p><i>But he was wounded for our transgressions, he was bruised for our iniquities: the chastisement of our peace was upon him; and with his stripes we are healed. (Isaiah 53:5)</i></p>
		  	<p>Jesus was wounded, bruised, chastised and eventually crucified, that we may receive Zoe (eternal life—God’s Kind of Life). Because of His death and resurrection, we have no reason whatsoever, to be ripped of our peace, health or Divine rights. Again, it is written:</p>
		  	<p><i>Beloved, I wish above all things that thou mayest prosper and be in health, even as thy soul prospereth. (3 John 1:2)</i></p>
		  	<p>In this letter of the Elder to Gaius, above all that could ever be wished for someone, he spoke about health and prosperity.</p>
		  	<p>Beloved, it is God’s will for us to walk in Divine health and prosperity. These things are our Divine rights.</p>
		  	<p>There is a human nature, and the Divine nature. The human nature is liable to sickness, poverty, subjection, fear, bondage, amongst others. But the Divine nature places a man in the position to reign in health, prosperity, liberty and grace.</p>
		  	<p>Beloved, something really great happens when a man gets born-again. Sadly, people are unaware of this, and as a result of their ignorance, they remain subject to things which should be subjected under them. When I was younger, I used to sing: </p>
		  	<p><i>Great change since I’m born again... the things I used to say, I say them no more... the things I used to do, I do them no more; I am changed since I’m born again.</i></p>
		  	<p>If your lifestyle, language and vocabulary have not changed since you got born-again, then you are still living below your Divine status.</p>
		  	<p>You cannot have the Divine Life and still be speaking of poverty, illness or depression. Beloved, sickness is something you should never tolerate for a second in your body system. Don’t negotiate with ill situations, speak right. Your words are powerful!</p>
		  	<p>The more we speak right, even when everything doesn’t seem right, the more our lives are aligned in the right course.</p>
		  	<p>Don’t make use of swear words like mere men in the world. Let your language distinguish you. Let your speech be for no other purpose than to edify. Ban negative words from your vocabulary, and speak right. Be blessed!</p>
