		  <div class="panel-body" style="text-align:justify">


		  	<p><i>Consider it wholly joyful, my brethren, whenever you are enveloped in or encounter trials of any sort or fall into various temptations.</i></p>
		  	<p><i>Be assured and understand that the trial and proving of your faith bring out endurance and steadfastness and patience.</i></p>
		  	<p><i>Blessed (happy, to be envied) is the man who is patient under trial and stands up under temptation, for when he has stood the test and been approved, he will receive [the victor’s] crown of life which God has promised to those who love Him. (James 1:2-3&12 AMP)</i></p>

		  	<blockquote>You can never be glorified if you’ve never been tried. Trial is what launches a man into glory. </blockquote>

		  	<p>So often, when people go through adverse trials, the attitude which seems most appropriate to them is to complain, compromise, or give up; this is because not many understand what trials really are.</p>
		  	<p>Many regard trials as that tough state that rips you off your peace and comfort. However, God’s Word makes us to understand that trials are nothing but a test of your faith, which in its completed state, ushers you into a higher realm of glory.</p>
		  	<p>You can never be glorified if you’ve never been tried. No matter how great God’s promises were to Abraham, they could not be completely fulfilled without trials. Likewise, no matter how great God’s Words over your life are, they can never be made manifest without trials.</p>
		  	<p>God had a promise land reserved for the Israelites, but they had to be tried all the way in the wilderness, before they could step into their promise.</p>
		  	<p>How then should we regard trials? Obviously, it is an interface between your present realm, and the glorified realm of your promise. Without a trial, those great Words and promises of God to you can never be accessed.</p>
		  	<p>Little wonder James admonishes us to consider it joyful when we are diversely tried; understanding that trial is what launches a man into glory.</p>
		  	<p>In the toughness of our trials, we might not feel like being joyful, but when you decide to remain joyful in hope, understanding that you are strengthened by joy, you will in no time bear its fruits (endurance, steadfastness and patience).</p>
		  	<p>These fruits will see to it that you are glorified through trials.</p>
		  	<p>There is a promise that awaits thee; there is a crown that lies before thee; if only you can stand firm through trials, and overcome every temptation, you will freely step into your promise.</p>
		  	<p>There was a great position that awaited Joseph; before he could step into that position, he had to stand firm in trials, and overcome the temptation of Potiphar’s wife.</p>
		  	<p>Trials are not there to break us, but to make us; celebrate trials just the same way you celebrate your victory, for through trials, we are assured that the breakthrough is just by the corner. Be blessed!</p>
