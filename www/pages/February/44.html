		  	<p><i>And the child grew, and waxed strong in spirit, and was in the deserts till the day of his shewing unto Israel. (Luke 1:80)</i></p>


		  	<blockquote>It is not everyone that deserves to know what God told you in private. Sometimes, there is a need to be alone. </blockquote>

		  	<p>John the Baptist abode in the desert till the days and seasons of his exposure and public manifestation. The desert is a very lonely environment... A place where no one dwells... A place that is dry, with nothing desirable within.</p>
		  	<p>I began to wonder how John the Baptist could have dwelled in such an environment. But I realised this truth — you can be alone, but not lonely —</p>
		  	<p>From the moment I gave my life to Christ, till this present time, I can admit that I have been alone so often, however, it is infeasible to hear me complain of loneliness. Many have assumed my life to be a shell of boredom, but really, I am never bored.</p>
		  	<p>When God gives man a mandate, he often sets them apart from the crowd. The vision and mandates of God are very precious and sensitive. When it is given to a man, it has a way of restricting a man to isolation, however ensuring that the man is never bored or lonely.</p>
		  	<p>It matters a lot who has access to your vision and assignment. It is of great importance that prior to the fulfilment of your divine mandate; you are separated, and set apart to incubate your vision.</p>
		  	<p>When this started in my life, I resorted to complaining... I said no one knows about me, neither is any close to me, but sooner, I understood that, like John the Baptist, I was only in the desert stage of my life, and that’s that stage that will launch me into a season of public manifestation.</p>
		  	<p>No one gets to the day of his shewing, without passing through his desert days. There are some assignments that a man cannot fulfil with some company... Some assignments require you to be alone.</p>
		  	<p>Abraham could not effectively offer Isaac, as long as he continued with his young men, and that’s why he boldly said to them, <i> “Abide ye here with the ass; and I and the lad will go yonder and worship, and come again to you.” (Genesis 22:5)</i></p>
		  	<p>Beloved, it is not everyone that deserves to know what God told you in private. It’s not everyone that deserves to be involved in your assignment. Sometimes, there is a need to be alone.</p>
		  	<p>However, as a Christian, we should not be lonely. The Spirit of God is our companion. What do you think John the Baptist must have been doing in the desert all the while? What do you think Jesus must have been doing in the wilderness for many days? Do you think they got lonely and bored?</p>
		  	<p>Indeed, their environment was a lonely place... They were alone, but never lonely. They fasted and prayed in the Spirit without cease; they constantly meditated on the Word of God, and received Rhema to strengthen them, at their various times.</p>
		  	<p>Beloved, like Jesus and John the Baptist, never let your environment define you. The fact that their environment was a lonely place, never limited them to boredom, they were burning with the power of God.</p>
		  	<p>Take advantage of the environment you are in today, and make changes from within. You may be alone, deserted, forsaken, but never get lonely... Never be limited!</p>
