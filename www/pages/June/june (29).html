		  	<p><i>Do nothing from selfish ambition or conceit, but in humility count others more significant than yourselves. Let each of you look not only to his own interests, but also to the interests of others (Philippians 2:3-4 ESV)</i></p>
		  

		  	<blockquote>An ambition that is selfish is not worth having; if my vision does not impact anyone positively, it is not from God.</blockquote>

		  	<p>Warren Buffett once said, “Someone’s sitting in the shade today because someone planted a tree a long time ago”</p>
		  	<p>Verily, someone labored to get the tree planted, for generations after to find shade in it; when that person was planting that tree, he was obviously not thinking of himself alone, but those coming after.</p>
		  	<p>The world is a better place to live in because of the legacies left behind by some people. What impact are you making to transform your world? To what extent will the generation after live better by your labor?</p>
		  	<p>The scripture today admonishes us not to look to our own interests alone, but to the interest of others. The natural man is a very selfish being, always thinking about what he has to benefit, without considering others.</p>
		  	<p>However, the supernatural man does nothing from selfish ambition, but counts others more significant than himself, in all humility. What kind of a man are you?</p>
		  	<p>What the world needs, in order to experience great transformation, is for each individual to deliberately dump his self ambition, which is confined in carnality; and embrace the great vision, which is divinely orchestrated to bless the generations after.</p>
		  	<p>An ambition that is selfish is not worth having; if my vision does not impact anyone positively, it is not from God.</p>
		  	<p>Joseph had a great vision, which blessed his family and saved an entire nation. We still reap the blessings of Abraham’s vision. The vision of Moses, defied captivity, and ushered in liberty. Esther’s purpose redeemed the entire Jewish nation. Jesus fulfilled a Divine purpose that has totally wiped out the old era of many limitations, and given us the Higher Life.</p>
		  	<p>It is obvious that men of purpose don’t live for their selfish interests alone, but to be a blessing to everyone else. Do something to bless your world today. Plant that tree that will serve as a shelter to generations after</p>
		  	<p>Don’t walk through the sandy shores without leaving a foot print; don’t live on earth without leaving a generation-saving legacy. The presence of many men on earth defines mere existence, but the presence of some others is life-changing. Be a life-changer; be a world-transformer. Don’t just exist. Live!</p>
		  	<p>Don’t make decisions today that will benefit you alone, if that decision cannot bless someone else, then it is not worth making. Drop your selfish ambitions; consider not your interests alone. Be blessed!</p>
