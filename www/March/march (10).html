		  	<p><i>And the Lord said unto him, Arise, and go into the street which is called Straight, and enquire in the house of Judas for one called Saul, of Tarsus: for, behold, he prayeth,</i></p>
		  	<p><i>And hath seen in a vision a man named Ananias coming in, and putting his hand on him, that he might receive his sight.</i></p>
		  	<p><i>Then Ananias answered, Lord, I have heard by many of this man, how much evil he hath done to thy saints at Jerusalem:</i></p>
		  	<p><i>And here he hath authority from the chief priests to bind all that call on thy name.</i></p>
		  	<p><i>But the Lord said unto him, Go thy way: for he is a chosen vessel unto me, to bear my name before the Gentiles, and kings, and the children of Israel: (Acts 9:11-15)</i></p>


		  	<blockquote>If God could refer to Saul as ‘chosen’, despite what men tagged him as, then it is obvious that God sees us differently.</blockquote>

		  	<p>The reputation of Saul was nothing worth deserving the interest of God. He was someone whom of his own accord yielded himself to the destruction of the Work of God.</p>
		  	<p>In life, I have encountered many hard-heartened men; such whom we could never imagine will give their lives to Christ. Saul was one of such kinds of men, but with a harder heart.</p>
		  	<p>It is amazing to fathom the truth that God could still use someone who has been blacklisted by all men.</p>
		  	<p>Many men are famous, but only a few are famous for virtuous things. Saul was exceptionally famous for his evil deeds. Who could ever imagine that he will eventually become more famous for virtuous things in Christ?</p>
		  	<p>When God sent Ananias to Saul, unlike he will respond to any other message from God, he decided to spare a moment to be sure that God was not out of his mind. He had to remind God of who Saul of Tarsus really was.</p>
		  	<p>Again, God assured him, that Saul has been chosen particularly to do the work that no one else may have been qualified to do. It is amazing who the Lord uses! It is written:</p>
		  	<p><i>But God hath chosen the foolish things of the world to confound the wise; and God hath chosen the weak things of the world to confound the things which are mighty;</i></p>
		  	<p><i>And base things of the world, and things which are despised, hath God chosen, yea, and things which are not, to bring to nought things that are: (1 Corinthians 1:27-28)</i></p>
		  	<p>Verily, God can still use foolish, weak and despised vessels to show forth his glory. So often, I have erred, and I felt like I had done the most abominable act, but a single prayer pushed me to the top instantly. I said, “Lord, if you will, you can still use me.”</p>
		  	<p>Beloved, no matter what we have done; no matter how foolish our decisions may have been; no matter how much men have despised us; no matter what weaknesses we may have yielded to in life; God can still use us!</p>
		  	<p>If he could transform Saul in a split second, there is nothing that disqualifies us from being used by God.</p>
		  	<p>If God could refer to Saul as ‘chosen’, despite what men tagged him as, then it is obvious that God sees us differently. Men may have called you weak, but rejoice, God loves to use weak people, to shame the strong.</p>
		  	<p>When you think you are strong enough, then you are not qualified for God’s work. He doesn’t choose the strong, but strengthens the chosen. Be blessed!</p>
