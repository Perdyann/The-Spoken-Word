		  <div class="panel-body" style="text-align:justify">


		  	<p><i>And, behold, there arose a great tempest in the sea, insomuch that the ship was covered with the waves: but he was asleep. (Matthew 8:24)</i></p>


		  	<blockquote>Stop throwing your goods into the storm when Jonah is still in the boat. The storm is demanding Jonah not the goods. </blockquote>

		  	<p>Amidst such an overwhelming storm, Jesus still had comfort enough to sleep. As I meditated on this passage for a moment, I was astonished by what I saw.</p>
		  	<p>To start with, the storm represents trials, tribulations and turmoil; the boat is our Ministry, business, or perhaps academics. And the people in the boat are the company with whom we run our affairs.</p>
		  	<p>There are two categories of people that sleep in the storm. Drawing from biblical experiences, two characters were reflected—Jesus and Jonah.</p>
		  	<p>Despite the fear, which the raging storm ushered, Jesus and Jonah were able to sleep—They slept for two different reasons!</p>
		  	<p>Jesus was fast asleep, because He needed to rest. Even when the storms rose, He was still asleep because He was not worried. He knew that nothing evil could befall them. He had great faith, in which He was well secured.</p>
		  	<p><i>But the Lord sent out a great wind into the sea, and there was a mighty tempest in the sea, so that the ship was like to be broken.</i></p>
		  	<p><i>Then the mariners were afraid, and cried every man unto his god, and cast forth the wares that were in the ship into the sea, to lighten it of them. But Jonah was gone down into the sides of the ship; and he lay, and was fast asleep. (Jonah 1:4-5)</i></p>
		  	<p>However, Jonah was asleep despite the storms, not because he was not worried, but because he was not concerned. He really didn’t care, because he knew that he was the reason for the storm. This was evident in his speech: <i> “for I know that for my sake this great tempest is upon you” (vs. 12). </i> He was ready for the worst, because he knew the gravity of atrocity he had committed, thus, he resorted to sleeping.</p>
		  	<p>Beloved, have you wondered why, in the midst of trials in our boats (Ministry, Business and Academics), some folks are nonchalantly sleeping over our utmost concern?</p>
		  	<p>Did you notice that when Jesus was about to be given up for crucifixion; prior to the time He was to be betrayed by Judas; at that moment when the burden of the tribulation He was to face, rested heavily upon Him; He confided in three of His disciples (Peter, James and John) to stand with Him in prayers; He prayed with so much passion that His sweat became like drops of blood, yet, his trusted disciples were nonchalantly sleeping. (Matthew 26:40-45)</p>
		  	<p>It hurts sometimes to realise that the people, whom we expect to stand by us at tough times, are really not concerned about our situation. However, some people, like Jesus, are just silent, not because they don’t care, but because they have Faith.</p>
		  	<p>When we have people like Jesus in our boats, we don’t need to fret. We can confidently smile at the storm, because such people stir-up our faith. In such situations, we are assured of reaching our destination without any loss whatsoever.</p>
		  	<p>What do we do when our boat is occupied by Jonahs? They are involved in our Ministries and Businesses, but are not concerned about the destination and safety of its affairs. They don’t care whether we crash down, or lose all our valuables.</p>
		  	<p>Sadly, in the case of Jonah, the sail men had lost all their valuables before they realised that Jonah was the cause of the storm. The earlier you develop the courage to cast out Jonah’s from your boat, the better guarantee you have for a safe and secure arrival to your destination.</p>
		  	<p>Furthermore, we should always understand what the cause of the storm is, before we dare to act. The storm demanded Jonah not the goods. There are storms we cannot calm, until we tackle it rightly. It is unfortunate that many have despised, and casted out their goods (real confidants, destiny helpers, treasures), before they realise that Jonah is the cause of the storm.</p>
		  	<p>Stop throwing your goods into the storm when Jonah is still in the boat. The storm is demanding Jonah not the goods. Avoid unnecessary loss!</p>
		  	<p>When people sleep in the storm, understand their reasons—Faith or fear—before you dare to act. May the Lord enable us to be discerning at all times, to the company we have involved in our Divine assignment. Be blessed!</p>
