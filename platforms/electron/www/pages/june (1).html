		  	<p><i>And the Gentiles shall see thy righteousness, and all kings thy glory: and thou shalt be called by a new name, which the mouth of the Lord shall name. (Isaiah 62:2)</i></p>


		  	<blockquote>We are the names we respond to. Men can call you anything, but your response is what proves their call” </blockquote>

		  	<p>Many people are identified by their names; most of these names have been given to them either from infancy, or by their present situations. Many live by the names men call them, and others choose to respond only to what God has called them.</p>
		  	<p>There are some people in the bible, whose biological names were not stated, but rather, they were defined solely by their circumstances.</p>
		  	<p>The woman with the issue of blood. The two lepers. the possessed man. blind man</p>
		  	<p>This is just to name a few; just like these fellows, some of us may have been termed by our predicament, rather than our names; at some point, we may have been referred to as, the forsaken fellow, that poor girl, amongst others.</p>
		  	<p>It hurts to see an ill situation replace your name; but what we sometimes fail to realize is, “we are the names we respond to. Men can call you anything, but your response is what proves their call”</p>
		  	<p>They can insist on calling you any name, but they cannot force you to answer to it.</p>
		  	<p>Jabez mother named him as a result of the pain she experienced in giving birth to him; but when Jabez prayed to God, his prayers broke the limits and boundaries, which his name had confined him in.</p>
		  	<p>Before everyone else, he was Jabez; but before God, he was blessed.</p>
		  	<p>Here’s the point, the fact that your mother has called you a name, does not mean that God refers to you by that name. God has a unique name which He calls you.</p>
		  	<p>Just like the woman with the issue of blood, don’t choose to remain in that shameful condition that men have tagged you with. Push for your miracle!</p>
		  	<p>Just like Jabez, don’t choose to be sorrowful because men have tagged you as the bearer of sorrows; find out what God calls you.</p>
		  	<p>The name God has given you, overshadows everything men have ever called you.</p>
		  	<p>Rather than living your life, based on the judgments and decisions of men, live up to what God has called you to be.</p>
		  	<p>You are any name you respond to; in essence, if you believe that you are Jabez, so shall you be, but if you see yourself as greater, then you shall live above everything.</p>
		  	<p>When men tell you that you’re not good enough, believe that you are the best of God’s creation. When men call you weak, declare strength. When men call you sorrow, profess greatness.</p>
		  	<p>Do not limit yourself to the name given by men, for God has called you by a new name.</p>
		  	<p>Some people have said to me, “what makes you think that you are better than average, you are not different from everyone else.” No! I never accepted that, I responded, “I am not average because you said I am, but I am extraordinarily great, because that’s what God calls me.”</p>
		  	<p>When you are diagnosed with an ailment, and given a time-frame to live, let your response be, “I am not sick and dying because you said I am; I am healed and a partaker of God’s Divine Nature, because that’s who God says I am.”</p>
		  	<p>It’s a choice. You can choose to bear the name tag men give, or to bear that of God; you can choose to accept the report of men; likewise, you can choose to live by God’s own report.</p>
		  	<p>Beloved, we are called by a new name, which the Lord has given; live by that name and accept nothing less. If the Lord has called you a success, how can you entertain thoughts of failure? You are so blessed!</p>
