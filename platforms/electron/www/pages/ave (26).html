		  	<p><i>And he departed, and began to publish in Decapolis how great things Jesus had done for him: and all men did marvel. (Mark 5:20)</i></p>

		  	<blockquote>Your testimony is an inspiration that is capable of giving souls the daily motivation and strength they need.</blockquote>

		  	<p>After unclean spirits (legion) had been driven out of the body of a certain man, he didn’t think of anything better to do than to testify. He published the whole reports, of all Jesus had done for him, in the whole of Decapolis, and all men marveled at it.</p>
		  	<p>This is quite unlike the attitude of the ten lepers who were healed, of whom only one returned in thanksgiving. (Luke 17:15-19). Beloved, there is something about an encounter with the Lord; you just can’t be silent about it.</p>
		  	<p>The man, who was liberated from the bond of unclean spirits, could not just be quiet about his encounter. He celebrated it, without forgetting to testify. His testimony was regarded marvelous, by all who heard it.</p>
		  	<p>As a result of his publications, all men did marvel! How powerful!</p>
		  	<p>Beloved, your testimony is an inspiration that is capable of giving souls the daily motivation and strength they need. Even when you have no insight to the Word of God, and when you don’t know anything to preach about, testify!</p>
		  	<p>When you want to win souls, and you don’t have anything to tell them, share your testimony! Everyone has a testimony; the only difference is our attitude to it. While some regard their testimonies as a Divine orchestration, and celebrate God for it, others regard it as a mere coincidence.</p>
		  	<p>When you were trusting God for a job, you promised to glorify Him if you are successful, but suddenly, when you get the job, you regard everything as a mere coincidence, and perhaps attribute your success to some other physical factors. That’s bad attitude!</p>
		  	<p>Bad attitude is not necessarily getting on people’s nerves by your terrible behavior, but responding wrongly, and contrary to God’s Word. The nine lepers, who never returned to glorify God, had bad attitudes!</p>
		  	<p>Beloved, your attitude towards receiving from God should be gratitude. This fellow expressed his gratitude to God, by publishing and testifying all the way through Decapolis.</p>
		  	<p>Sometimes, God allows us to go through the fire, and come out of it unburned, so that by our testimony, we can inspire those who are currently in the fire. It is an exhibition of bad attitude to leave the fire, without redeeming those in it with your testimony.</p>
		  	<p>Many people are struggling through the bridge, which you have crossed over; why not publish the reports of your testimony. Your publication might be the only inspiration a generation needs, in order to be redeemed. Publish it!</p>
