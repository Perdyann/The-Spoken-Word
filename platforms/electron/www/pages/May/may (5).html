		  	<p><i>But they that wait upon the Lord shall renew their strength; they shall mount up with wings as eagles; they shall run, and not be weary; and they shall walk, and not faint. (Isaiah 40:31)</i></p>

		  	<blockquote>Don’t rush God’s timing – We need to understand the seasons we are in, in order to be able to function properly in it.</blockquote>

		  	<p>Sometimes, situations seem so tough and rough, that we are unwilling to wait; we just want to get over them immediately. There are seasons when we feel that we have waited long enough.</p>
		  	<p>If there’s one thing we should learn and embrace, it is—Don’t rush God’s timing—We need to understand the seasons we are in, in order to be able to function properly in it. Ecclesiastes 3 makes us to understand that there is a time for everything.</p>
		  	<p>God has an ordained time for you to get a job, a spouse or anything else. Rushing into things will only get you caught up in a mess that might take you more time to get out of.</p>
		  	<p>What we must understand is—There is a blessing in waiting on the Lord—The blessing is not just in waiting, but waiting on the Lord.</p>
		  	<p>Let’s spare a moment to understand what it means to wait on the Lord.</p>
		  	<p>Waiting on the Lord entails waiting with positive expectations. I was once asked, “Which is a better attitude: being optimistic, pessimistic, or realistic?”</p>
		  	<p>A couple of people insisted on being realistic, and justified it saying, “When you are realistic, you face facts as they really are.” Some others justified being pessimistic, saying, “When you are pessimistic, you expect the worst, and so you can never be disappointed.”</p>
		  	<p>Unlike these fellows, in my perspective, scripturally speaking, being Optimistic is always the best. When you wait on the Lord and you trust in your God, He will give you nothing but the best. God can never give you anything below the best quality; hence, my expectations are channeled towards the best of God’s ability.</p>
		  	<p>Furthermore, waiting on the Lord is waiting in faith. According to Hebrews 11, Faith is the assurance of things hoped for: Therefore, when we wait on God in faith, we are already assured that we will be granted everything we hope for. In essence, we should remain optimistic, expecting God’s best.</p>
		  	<p>In addition, waiting on the Lord entails abiding in His Word. I often tell people that are going through diverse trials to stick to the Word of God. For every problem, there is a Word solution; if you can only locate that one Word of God for you in every season, and declare it in faith, day and night, you will be transposed to God’s ideal realm for you.</p>
		  	<p>The blessings for waiting on the Lord are pronounced thus:</p>
		  	<p><i>Shall renew their strength;</i> When it seems like you are running out of strength, ability, zeal and passion, you shall receive a second wind. For every bit of strength and iota of zeal that has been consumed, God will replenish, and renew it in double folds.</p>
		  	<p><i>They shall mount up with wings as eagles; </i> Not every winged animal soars very high. When it comes to attaining the highest height on air, the eagle is well respected. Therefore, God is assuring us, that we shall mount on wings, not like ducks, but eagles. In essence, we shall attain heights that other birds (people) have not thought of reaching.</p>
		  	<p><i>They shall run, and not be weary; and they shall walk, and not faint. </i> The journey that others have embarked on, and failed, you shall accomplish it in strength. You shall never get weary or tired of producing results.</p>
		  	<p>Beloved, it is indeed a blessing to wait, but more blessed to wait with the right attitude . . . Wait on the Lord; have positive expectations, and you shall receive God’s best. Be blessed!</p>
