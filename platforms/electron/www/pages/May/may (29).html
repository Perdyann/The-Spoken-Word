		  	<p><i>Then the word of the Lord came unto me, saying,</i></p>
		  	<p><i>Before I formed thee in the belly I knew thee; and before thou camest forth out of the womb I sanctified thee, and I ordained thee a prophet unto the nations.</i></p>
		  	<p><i>Then said I, Ah, Lord God! behold, I cannot speak: for I am a child</i></p>
		  	<p><i>But the Lord said unto me, Say not, I am a child: for thou shalt go to all that I shall send thee, and whatsoever I command thee thou shalt speak.</i></p>
		  	<p><i>Be not afraid of their faces: for I am with thee to deliver thee, saith the Lord. (Jeremiah 1:4-8)</i></p>


		  	<blockquote>Do not let people’s definition of you, and attitude towards you to limit God’s purpose over your life. </blockquote>

		  	<p>Jeremiah was called and chosen by God before his birth. But there was something that kept him from operating in that call, all the while. He looked down on his ability; he felt too young and naive to do God’s work; he didn’t have the courage to act in his office, because he merely thought himself a child.</p>
		  	<p>Beloved, just like Jeremiah, many of us are quite aware of our purpose in life, but for some reason, we just can’t find ourselves living a Purpose driven life. Some may feel too young, some may feel too timid, and some may feel too inexperienced. However, God’s Word for you today is, ‘refuse to be degraded.’</p>
		  	<p>Considering the fact that not many children are Prophets, you will understand exactly how Jeremiah (a child) felt when God told him that He had ordained him a Prophet.</p>
		  	<p>The world has tagged ability to ages, and so the best and worst anyone could expect from another is to a large extent determined by the person’s age. We might not consider a Prophecy from a child, as important as that from a renowned older speaker. Jeremiah’s resistance was his fear that he might be degraded and not taken seriously.</p>
		  	<p>However, this ought not to be so. God’s Word should not be limited to the age of its carrier. It is written:</p>
		  	<p><i>Out of the mouth of babes and sucklings hast thou ordained strength because of thine enemies, that thou mightest still the enemy and the avenger. (Psalms 8:2)</i></p>
		  	<p>Verily, God could manifest His glory, in the height of its magnitude, through the degraded. God can speak through anybody and anything; He can take over the mouth of babies, and children in order to minister to the hard-heartened adults. He is God!</p>
		  	<p>You can be young and serve the Lord! You can be fifteen and accomplish all that a fifty year old man has never thought of. Get rid of the world’s perspective of ability; only measure your ability with God’s Word.</p>
		  	<p>It is therefore of no surprise that Paul writes to Timothy stating,</p>
		  	<p><i>Don’t let anyone look down on you because you are young, but set an example for the believers in speech, in conduct, in love, in faith and in purity. (1 Timothy 4:12)</i></p>
		  	<p>Beloved, if you want to be used by God, get ready to be pressed on all sides, BUT in all these, refuse to be degraded.</p>
		  	<p>Never let the attitude of the congregation determine your level of confidence. The attitude of everyone towards a young Prophet will be a bit discriminatory, but Jeremiah never allowed that to tamper with his confidence. Against all odds, he refused to be degraded!</p>
		  	<p>Beloved, learn from these words; the LORD has put His Words in your mouth, He has deposited so much virtues in you, He has set you over nations and Kingdoms, He has given you the power to establish and demolish.</p>
		  	<p>As a Son of God, you have been given great authority to reign on earth. Do not let people’s definition of you, and attitude towards you to limit God’s purpose over your life.</p>
		  	<p>Jeremiah was a child in the eyes of everyone else, but a Prophet in God’s eyes. David was a small boy in the eyes of Goliath, but was a Warrior in the eyes of God.</p>
		  	<p>You are much more than the world might make of you. Refuse to be degraded! Refuse to see yourself the way everyone else sees you, but view yourself from the eyes of God. Be blessed!</p>
