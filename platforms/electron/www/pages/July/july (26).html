		  	<p><i>But by what means he now seeth, we know not; or who hath opened his eyes, we know not: he is of age; ask him: he shall speak for himself.</i></p>
		  	<p><i>These words spake his parents, because they feared the Jews: for the Jews had agreed already, that if any man did confess that he was Christ, he should be put out of the synagogue.</i></p>
		  	<p><i>Therefore said his parents, He is of age; ask him. (John 9:21-23)</i></p>


		  	<blockquote>If you are not bold enough to declare the truth, even when a threat is involved, then you’re not sold out to it yet.</blockquote>

		  	<p>How scared could you be, to acknowledge the truth when it is accompanied by a threat? Here’s the case of a man who was born blind; the chances of him gaining sight in his entire lifetime was totally paralyzed.</p>
		  	<p>Everyone had presumed that he was suffering from either his iniquities, or that of his parents. Just when all hope was lost for this man, Jesus healed him.</p>
		  	<p>His healing was not easily comprehendible, considering the fact that he was born blind. While everyone wondered if it was the same blind man, the Pharisees chose to investigate.</p>
		  	<p>The Pharisees were religious law keepers, who doubted the Ministry of Jesus. Likewise, the Jews were ready to put out anyone, who acknowledged Jesus as Christ, from the synagogue.</p>
		  	<p>I presume no one wanted to be put out of the synagogue. Therefore, when his parents were asked about his healing, they claimed not to know anything, and then forwarded the question back to their son, not wanting to give any response.</p>
		  	<p>Their reason for not responding to the question is clearly stated — fear! Deep within their hearts, they knew that Jesus Christ, the Son of God, had healed their son, but did not want to acknowledge this truth, for the fear of the Jews.</p>
		  	<p>Beloved, the truth is the light; it is something that cannot be concealed. If you are not bold enough to declare the truth, even when a threat is involved, then you’re not sold out to it yet.</p>
		  	<p>Be ready to stand out openly for the truth. Peter was a disciple of Jesus, he had assured Jesus that he will never deny him, however, when a threat was affixed to the truth, he denied three times, without realizing it.</p>
		  	<p>The truth was that he was a follower of Jesus, but this had a threat of being persecuted with him. Peter was more scared of the threat than he was proud of the truth.</p>
		  	<p>Are you scared of the threat, or proud of the truth? Your stand is defined by how you respond, when confronted with these two. Will you hold on to the truth or will you compromise for the threat?</p>
		  	<p>Jesus is the Way, the Truth and the Life. If you have not identified with the truth over every threat, then you have not received Jesus yet. Be blessed!</p>
