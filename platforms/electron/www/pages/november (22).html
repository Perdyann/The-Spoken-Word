		  	<p><i>Know ye not that they which run in a race run all, but one receiveth the prize? So run, that ye may obtain. (1 Corinthians 9:24)</i></p>
		 

		  	<blockquote>Difference is what defines the winner of a race; you must not run on the track of everyone else; you must  not follow the pace of everyone else. </blockquote>

		  	<p>Great men don’t just run a race, in order to be recognized as mere participants; they run intently, with a motive and goal of winning, and obtaining the prize.</p>
		  	<p>Don’t just run for the pleasure and fun of it; don’t just run for a sense of belonging; don’t just run for that recognition as an athlete. Run with a focus and goal of being the best; start the race with a target of outrunning the other contestants.</p>
		  	<p>Many athletes contest in a race; each of them have different motives and principles. What defines the winner is a predefined target, with embedded means of obtaining the crown.</p>
		  	<p>Anything worth doing is worth doing well; if a race is worth running, it is worth running well. Life is a race; if it is worth living, then it is worth living well. It is a waste of time and effort, running a race, without having a victorious intention.</p>
		  	<p>The scripture today admonishes us to run, that we may obtain. Although many contestants are involved in the race, we must run in a way that makes us outstanding.</p>
		  	<p>For a single winner to be chosen out of a multitude of athletes, that winner must have done something that the crowd never thought of doing.</p>
		  	<p>Great men are not those, who merely followed the crowd, but those, who have proven to be outstanding. Don’t try to be an imitation of everyone else; don’t make it a compulsion to follow the path of everyone else. Stick to the direction of the Holy Spirit, even when it seems like a weird path.</p>
		  	<p>Be different from the world, have clearly defined goals and target. Be outstanding!</p>
		  	<p>You can be outstanding irrespective of your career; many politicians were corrupt, but at least one stood out; many professionals were treacherous, but at least one stood out. Choose to be the one that will stand out, even when everyone else is compromising.</p>
		  	<p>Amongst the crowd that stood in the front of a displayed idol; Shedrach, Meshach and Abednego fetched themselves recognition and promotion, because they stood out, even when everyone else was ignorantly bowing.</p>
		  	<p>Difference is what defines the winner of a race; you must not run on the track of everyone else; you must not follow the pace of everyone else; only run that ye may obtain. Be outstanding!</p>
