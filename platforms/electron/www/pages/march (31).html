		  	<p><i>There are many devices in a man’s heart; nevertheless the counsel of the Lord, that shall stand. (Proverbs 19:21)</i></p>

		  	<blockquote>True peace emanates from a man’s conscious decision to die to his self-will, and live to the glory of God.</blockquote>

		  	<p>A man’s heart is hardly void of a plan. Before a man goes to bed at night, he often ensures that his schedule for the next day is fixed.</p>
		  	<p>We receive invitations often. Before a week is spent, we are quite sure of the activities we intend to have during the weekend. We make plans for holidays, shopping, outings, trips, amongst others.</p>
		  	<p>What most people fail to realize is that the most important thing is not our plan, but the will and disposition of God. Most of the devices and plans we make up in our mind are sometimes outside the will of God. This ought not to be so. Our plans may fail, but God’s plan for our life is certain. (Jeremiah 29:11)</p>
		  	<p>Except our plans are aligned to God’s will, we may hardly know stability. If Jonah was planning in the will of God, he would have boarded a ship to Nineveh, and not Tarshish. Consequently, he was ripped off his peace and freedom, as he spent 3 nights in the belly of the fish.</p>
		  	<p>Jonah’s act of insisting on his own ways, led to some consequential end. There are indeed consequences for acting based on our self-will. True peace emanates from a man’s conscious decision to die to his self-will, and live to the glory of God.</p>
		  	<p>Jonah chose to learn the hard way, but we must not follow suit. Much more than we regard our plans, we should consider the disposition of God. It is written:</p>
		  	<p><i>A man’s heart deviseth his way: but the Lord directeth his steps. (Proverbs 16:9)</i></p>
		  	<p>Beloved, so often, we have prayed amiss. I have prayed for an open door many times, and within those periods, I have seen many opportunities and offers that seemed so much like answers to my prayers, but God said no!</p>
		  	<p>Not every offer or opportunity is of God. Much more than we desire things to fall in the places that seem pleasant to us, we should be discerning enough to the will of God.</p>
		  	<p>God has a unique plan for our lives. His disposition and arrangement may be different from our initial propositions, however, unlike Jonah, we must submit to the will of God. It is written:</p>
		  	<p><i>There is a way which seemeth right unto a man, but the end thereof are the ways of death. (Proverbs 14:12)</i></p>
		  	<p>Beloved, think about the steps you are about to take. Are they based on your plans or God’s own? It might seem so right. it might seem like the opportunity you’ve waited for, but be careful and discerning enough to confirm that it is God’s plan before you move.</p>
		  	<p>Ask the Lord to order your steps, schedules and appointments daily. We must submit to the will of God. Be blessed!</p>
