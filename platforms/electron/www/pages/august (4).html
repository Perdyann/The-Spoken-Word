		  	<p><i>Jesus asked the man, “What do you want me to do for you?” He answered, “Teacher, I want to see again.” (Mark 10:51 ERV)</i></p>

		  	<blockquote>The magnitude of your greatness is to a large extent, determined by a clear understanding of your wants.</blockquote>

		  	<p>Quite a number of people have compromised for petty attractions, because they never really had a standard; many are carried away by every wind, because they really don’t know what they want.</p>
		  	<p>Without a full understanding of what you want, in all clarity, you can easily end up in a wrong place.</p>
		  	<p>There was a reason behind Bartimaeus’ shouts and screams when he heard that Jesus was passing by; not only did he want something from the Master, he knew exactly what he wanted.</p>
		  	<p>When Jesus heard his persistent screams, He asked a simple but demanding question, <i> “What do you want me to do for you?” </i> This question demanded an understanding of want, without which the miracle could not be performed.</p>
		  	<p>Immediately, Bartimaeus stated in clarity what he wanted from the Master — sight! Bartimaeus would have missed out if he did not know exactly what he wanted.</p>
		  	<p>The book of 1 Chronicles 1:7 narrates how God came to Solomon, and asked him to state his wants, that He might fulfil them. We must understand that God was ready to give to Solomon anything he wanted.</p>
		  	<p>The extent of Solomon’s greatness was determined by his response to that question. Likewise, the magnitude of your greatness is to a large extent, determined by a clear understanding of your wants.</p>
		  	<p>If Solomon did not know what he wanted—wisdom, he would have missed out. His greatness emanated from his initial knowledge of what he wanted.</p>
		  	<p>That’s how important it is to understand in clarity, what you want. Many have encountered opportunities, but because they did not know for themselves, what they wanted, they missed out! It is written:</p>
		  	<p><i>He listens to his followers and does what they want. He answers their prayers and saves them. (Psalms 145:19 ERV)</i></p>
		  	<p>Verily, as this scripture states, The Lord listens to His followers; He does what they want and desire; He answers their prayers. However, if these followers do not know what they want, then nothing can be done for them.</p>
		  	<p>God granted unto Bartimaeus sight, because that was what He wanted. He granted Wisdom to Solomon because that was what He wanted. Beloved, if the Lord requests your wants today, what will your response be?</p>
		  	<p>It is not enough that you pray to get married before the year runs out; you must have knowledge of what you want from marriage, and your future spouse. Without this knowledge, you can easily fall for disguised traps.</p>
		  	<p>People are so desperate to get married to just anyone, because they have no idea of what they really want. They end up rushing out of it in the same way they rushed into it.</p>
		  	<p>God gives to His followers even greater than what they want; this implies that there has to be an initial want in order for you to experience greater. Do you know what you want?</p>
		  	<p>Bartimaeus wanted sight, Jesus fulfilled that; Solomon wanted wisdom, God granted him even more; the lepers wanted to be clean, Jesus made them whole.</p>
		  	<p>However, as much as we should have knowledge of what we want, we should also be conscious of having our wants in line with the will of God. You cannot have what you want if it contrasts God’s plan for your life.</p>
		  	<p>Beloved, outline your wants and desires today, based on the Word of God. Establish a foundation, by setting a godly standard for yourself today, and let God do the finishing. Be blessed!</p>
