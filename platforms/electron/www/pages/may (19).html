		  <div class="panel-body" style="text-align:justify">


		  	<p><i>You might think you are a very religious person. But if your tongue is out of control, you are fooling yourself. Your careless talk makes your offerings to God worthless. The worship that God wants is this: caring for orphans or widows who need help and keeping yourself free from the world’s evil influence. This is the kind of worship that God accepts as pure and good. (James 1:26-27 ERV)</i></p>

		  	<blockquote>If you have not grown to recognise the needs of your neighbours, you have not started worshipping in God’s acceptable way.</blockquote>

		  	<p>This passage starts with the terminology, “you might think you are religious but ...” This particularly portrays the fact that some people actually think they are religious, but God considers their religion as being worthless, foolish and a waste of time. This is because their words do not back up what they claim to represent.</p>
		  	<p>It matters a lot how you speak. As this passage implies, your speech is capable of disqualifying your worship. Sons of God don’t talk like mere people of the world. Some words are banned from our vocabulary. It is written:</p>
		  	<p><i>Let your speech be always with grace, seasoned with salt, that ye may know how ye ought to answer every man. (Colossians 4:6)</i></p>
		  	<p>No matter how religious you regard yourself as, when your speech lacks the season (flavour & spice) and grace of God’s Word, you are merely fooling yourself.</p>
		  	<p>Your careless talk makes everything you labour for — your worship, reputation, and service—worthless. What kind of worship is acceptable before God?</p>
		  	<p>Just two things are mentioned in this particular scripture: caring for the needy, and abstaining from the defilement of the world.</p>
		  	<p>To what extent do you care for those around you? So often we have read about the rich man and Lazarus; the only thing that led the rich man to hell was lack of loving care. He probably saw Lazarus every day, feeding from his crumbs, but was not caring enough to meet him at the point of his need.</p>
		  	<p>Beloved, going to church every day is not enough if you walk out always, without being a blessing to those around you. The rich man may have been a regular church goer, but was not sensitive enough to the needs of the poor beggar at his gate.</p>
		  	<p>If you have not grown to recognise the needs of your neighbours, you have not started worshipping in God’s acceptable way.</p>
		  	<p>Furthermore, we are admonished to keep ourselves from the world’s evil influence. You cannot love God, and love the world at the same time. It is written:</p>
		  	<p><i>Ye adulterers and adulteresses, know ye not that the friendship of the world is enmity with God? whosoever therefore will be a friend of the world is the enemy of God. (James 4:4)</i></p>
		  	<p>Verily, loving the world is enmity with God. No man, who is sold out to worshipping God, will still cling to the things of the world. Give up the worldly lifestyle, attitude and passions.</p>
		  	<p>You are not of the world, but the WORD. There is no point growing in conformity to the world. Beloved, stick to the WORD, live by it and grow in the love, wisdom and Knowledge of God. This is the kind of worship that God accepts as pure and good. Be blessed!</p>
