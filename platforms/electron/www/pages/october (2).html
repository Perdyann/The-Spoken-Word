		  	<p><i>For promotion cometh neither from the east, nor from the west, nor from the south.</i></p>
		  	<p><i>But God is the judge: he putteth down one, and setteth up another. (Psalms 75:6-7)</i></p>
		  	

		  	<blockquote>Favor will grant you that promotion, which your credentials could never afford. </blockquote>

		  	<p>I always thought that promotion was on the basis of good works, credentials, experience and efforts, until I encountered the Word of God. This opened my eyes to the truth that neither our efforts, ability, nor credentials can grant us promotion, but God’s Grace, Mercy, and Favor.</p>
		  	<p>Esther was not promoted to the position of a Queen on the basis of her works, experience or efforts. It was God’s Grace, Mercy and Favor that led her there for a purpose, which revealed itself in time.</p>
		  	<p>Justification is not by works; the race is not to the swift; promotion is not by credentials; but by the Grace, Mercy and Favor of the Lord</p>
		  	<p><b>Grace</b> is portrayed in receiving without struggles, and producing sweatless results. People may have worked like elephants, and earned like ants; but when grace is involved, the reverse becomes the case. You can be justified without works; that’s grace!</p>
		  	<p><b>Mercy</b> is portrayed in receiving that, which you did not deserve. You may not have been the swiftest in the race, nor the strongest in the battle; you may not have been the most prepared for that exams, you might not have acted in the right way, but mercy can grant you the crown and victory you never deserved.</p>
		  	<p><b>Favor</b> is portrayed in receiving that, which you didn’t even ask for. Mordecai did well to the King, but never asked for a reward. Just one night, when the favor of God located him, the king began to browse through the records, and decided to reward Mordecai for the good which he did previously.</p>
		  	<p>When the time of your favor arrives, the King will become restless for your sake. Favor will grant you that promotion, which your credentials could never afford.</p>
		  	<p>Imagine how soothing it will be, if a man’s life is filled with a blend of the Grace, Mercy and Favor of God. Beloved, this might have been infeasible to attain in the past, but we are in an era where it is all made available through the Holy Spirit.</p>
		  	<p>Subsequently, we will be studying about the throne of grace, in relation to God’s Grace, Mercy and Favor.</p>
		  	<p>Where you are now, is not the best place you can be; receive His Grace, Mercy, and Favor to grant you in ease, all that you need to live a fulfilled life. Be blessed!</p>
