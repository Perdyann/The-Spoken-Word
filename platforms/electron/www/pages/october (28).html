		  	<p><i>And, behold, thou shalt conceive in thy womb, and bring forth a son, and shalt call his name JESUS.</i></p>
		  	<p><i>Then said Mary unto the angel, How shall this be, seeing I know not a man? (Luke 1:30&34)</i></p>
		  

		  	<blockquote>The birth of Jesus through a virgin portrays one thing – Supernatural things are never birthed through the usual means.</blockquote>

		  	<p>What the Angel of the Lord told Mary sounded too unusual, that she had to ask how it shall be manifested. She had to remind him that they were natural protocols to be observed. </p>
		  	<p>The pregnancy of a virgin is unusual; being born of a virgin is unusual; being born in a manger was unusual; having to flee to Egypt for a while was unusual. Verily, the child was not ordinary, but destined for a purpose.</p>
		  	<p>The birth of Jesus through a virgin portrays one thing—Supernatural things are never birthed through the usual means.</p>
		  	<p>The sign of an unusual procedure is an evidence that something supernatural is about to happen.</p>
		  	<p>It was not in the nature of Herod to murder babies, but when Jesus was born, he sought to kill him. As a result, they all had to flee to Egypt until the death of Herod. (Matthew 2:13)</p>
		  	<p>The only reason why Herod sought to kill Jesus is because it was foretold that He will be a great King. In essence, Herod was not against Jesus, but against His greatness and purpose.</p>
		  	<p>Mary did not deliver on a hospital bed, with the midwives around; but in a manger, probably surrounded by cattle.</p>
		  	<p>Mary did not have a normal birth, because she was not carrying an ordinary child. Don’t expect to face the normal challenges when you carry a Kingdom vision affixed with many great mandates.</p>
		  	<p>Your challenges are weighed in accordance with the kind of vision you are pregnant with. Supernatural things are always manifested through unusual means, challenges and trials.</p>
		  	<p>When things seem unusual, with many challenges affixed, don’t be discouraged; it obvious that there is something great within.</p>
		  	<p>The challenge might not be something that you are used to, but certainly, the result is also greater than what you are used to. Don’t be in a haste to quit unusual challenges; if you hold on till the end, you’d realize that there is something supernatural about it.</p>
		  	<p>When there is an unusual pregnancy, like the case of Mary, then there’d surely be an extra-ordinary child. Extra-ordinary people go through extra-ordinary trials, but surely emerge with extra-ordinary results. Don’t expect to go through ordinary procedures, when you know that there is something extra ordinary about you.</p>
		  	<p>You’ve been through thick and thin; but all that you went through was for the release of something great. In the worst trials, expect the best results. Be blessed!</p>
