		  	<p><i>For verily I say unto you, That whosoever shall say unto this mountain, Be thou removed, and be thou cast into the sea; and shall not doubt in his heart, but shall believe that those things which he saith shall come to pass; he shall have whatsoever he saith. (Mark 11:23)</i></p>
		  	

		  	<blockquote>Why cry to God endlessly when you’ve not spoken to the mountains yet? </blockquote>

		  	<p>On various occasions, Jesus admonished His disciples to speak to the mountains in faith, and they shall respond positively. A mountain is anything that stands in your way, hinders your motion and exalts itself above your path.</p>
		  	<p>There are many things, which are perceived to be mountains; such as mountain of poverty, mountain of failure or perhaps mountain of defeat. The reason why some people have suffered stagnancy in their lives is because there is a mountain right in front of them, which they’ve not been able to subdue.</p>
		  	<p>Many have been limited by poverty, failure, defeat and lack. They cry to God day and night, yet see no result. This led some to the conclusion that God does not exist. I’ve heard people say, “Where was God when I was defeated? Where was God when I was infirmed? He really does not exist or care.”</p>
		  	<p>Obviously, the reason why they must have harbored such thoughts is because in their own perspective, they have cried to Him endlessly, but He has not responded to their tears.”</p>
		  	<p>It all comes down to ignorance; many are ignorant of this scripture, not because they have never read it, but because they have never understood it, or received it as a personal revelation (Rhema).</p>
		  	<p>Did you notice that God has given us the authority to speak to any mountain, and it must obey? Why cry to God endlessly when you’ve not spoken to the mountains yet?</p>
		  	<p>God has sent His Word, and that settles it. Everything else is in your hand! The Word of God will not work until you work it.</p>
		  	<p>What does the Word say? When you encounter mountains, hindrances and limitations on your path, speak to them in faith. It did not say that we should cry to God, but speak to the mountains. Therefore beloved, don’t cry to God, when you have not spoken to the mountains yet.</p>
		  	<p>The Word of faith is able to create and destroy; build and demolish; plant and uproot. When God spoke His Words to the dark, void and formless earth, it became full of light, shape and life. Beloved, we have the same Word of God in our spirit.</p>
		  	<p>When you speak to the tall, coarse and tough mountains, they have no choice than to become a plain. By our Words of Faith, we can subdue and level the tallest and most challenging mountains.</p>
		  	<p>Enough of the tears; enough of the pity-party; speak in faith to the mountains now, and they shall respond to the authority of your Words. Be blessed!</p>
