		  	<p><i>Thou shalt arise, and have mercy upon Zion: for the time to favour her, yea, the set time, is come. (Psalm 102:13)</i></p>
		
		  	<blockquote>Favor has the capacity to translate a man, within seconds to a realm that took others years to attain. </blockquote>

		  	<p>Favor is what grants a man the preferential support, which he never deserved. Favor has the capacity to translate a man, within seconds to a realm that took others years to attain.</p>
		  	<p>Favor can grant to a man, that, which his ability and efforts could never yield. In the life of every great man, there is a testimony of favor. Studying through the scriptures, we realize that the likes of Daniel, Joseph, Jesus, Noah, Esther, and many more experienced an uncommon favor.</p>
		  	<p>God granted Daniel favor in the sight of the prince of the eunuchs (Daniel 1:9), thus, when he had made up his mind not to defile himself with the portion of the King’s meat or wine, he received support.</p>
		  	<p>Joseph met favor virtually everywhere he went; he did not have the support of his brothers, but favor boosted him to the realm where his brothers could not reach. Studying carefully, through the story of Joseph, you’d realize that from the moment his brothers sold him, he found favor in the house of Pharaoh; even when he was framed up and thrown into the prison, the Lord still granted him favor in the sight of the prison keeper.</p>
		  	<p>Favor placed Joseph in charge of everywhere he was; because of the favor he found in Pharaoh’s sight, he was placed in charge of the house; because of the favor he found in the sight of the prison keeper, he was made in charge of all prisoners. Favor has a way of locating a man from beneath, and catapulting him to the top.</p>
		  	<p>About Jesus, it is recorded that He grew in wisdom, stature and favor with God and men. (Luke 2:52)</p>
		  	<p>Ever wondered what spared Noah from being destroyed even when all other men were to be wiped off by the flood? In Genesis 6:8, it is recorded that Noah found favor in the sight of God.</p>
		  	<p>What was Esther’s qualification for the position of a Queen? Favor! Favor was all that qualified her to occupy that position, which she did not deserve.</p>
		  	<p>Beloved, favor preserves, elevates, qualifies, glorifies and adorns a man. Even when you lack credentials and requirements for a position, favor leads you there.</p>
		  	<p>The scripture today clearly states that our set time for favor has come. Beloved, you have been in your situation for too long; you have toiled endlessly for too long; today, the favor of the Lord will rest on you, and lead you to a height, which no man has ever attained.</p>
		  	<p>Because of the favor of the Lord in your life, what should have been tragic will turn out to be a testimony. Every denial of the past will be summed up in one appointment. You are the favored of the Lord!</p>
