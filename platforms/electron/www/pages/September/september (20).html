		  	<p><i>For in Him the whole fullness of Deity (the Godhead) continues to dwell in bodily form [giving complete expression of the divine nature].</i></p>
		  	<p><i>And you are in Him, made full and having come to fullness of life [in Christ you too are filled with the Godhead—Father, Son and Holy Spirit—and reach full spiritual stature]. And He is the Head of all rule and authority [of every angelic principality and power]. (Colossians 2:9-10 AMP)</i></p>
		  	

		  	<blockquote>It is an error for any man to be in Christ, and live an ordinary life. Mediocrity is not meant for people who have the fullness of the Godhead in them</blockquote>

		  	<p>Initially, this passage describes Jesus, as one, who has the fullness of Godhead dwelling in Him; subsequently, in the next verse, it is clearly stated that we are also filled with the Godhead.</p>
		  	<p>As portrayed in the scripture passage, here’s what the Godhead does to a man—it gives him the ability to completely express the divine nature.</p>
		  	<p>In essence, if Jesus could completely express the divine nature, because of the fullness of the Godhead in Him, we can now express that same nature, because we are also filled with the Godhead.</p>
		  	<p>There is a human nature, and also the divine nature. The nature being spoken about in the verses above is the divine nature.</p>
		  	<p>The human nature is subject to worldly rules and principles; it is prone to attack, and very vulnerable to infirmities and ill circumstances. It has no control or power over sickness, poverty, failure, and lack. People, who operate by this nature, live at the mercy of the merciless devil.</p>
		  	<p>Unlike the human nature, the divine nature is above worldly protocols, rules and principles. Men, who operate by this nature, control natural affairs from a supernatural realm of authority. They don’t negotiate with ill circumstances; they know exactly where they stand in the realm of the spirit.</p>
		  	<p>Jesus completely expressed the divine nature. He walked on water, healed the sick, fed a multitude with few loaves and fish, changed water to wine, casted out demons without any negotiation, and lived a life of absolute authority. He never walked without a consciousness of His divine status.</p>
		  	<p>Likewise beloved, because we are now in Christ, we are also filled with the Godhead, thus, we have the ability to live just like Christ lived.</p>
		  	<p>It is an error for any man to be in Christ, and live an ordinary life. Mediocrity is not meant for people who have the fullness of the Godhead in them. No!</p>
		  	<p>It is time for Sons to rise to their place and begin to control the world with an authority from above. Don’t accept what the world has to offer, command the earth to yield to you, what you desire.</p>
		  	<p>Do not be conformed to, shaped and controlled by the world, let the reverse be the case. Influence the world with the deposit of God in your spirit. Be blessed!</p>
