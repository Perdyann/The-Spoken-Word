		  	<p><i>And day after day they regularly assembled in the temple with united purpose, and in their homes they broke bread [including the Lord’s Supper]. They partook of their food with gladness and simplicity and generous hearts, (Acts 2:46 AMP)</i></p>

		  	<blockquote>Without persistence, no man will reach his destiny; without persistence, no great idea will be established; without persistence, we can never go far in life. </blockquote>

		  	<p>Our early days are not always the best; we all have our days of little beginnings, when we’ve been challenged and persecuted in all ways. What keeps us strong is persistence.</p>
		  	<p>I recall vividly an instance when my mum was driving, and the vehicle ran out of petrol, and stopped moving. There was no petrol station nearby, we were stranded.</p>
		  	<p>After thinking deeply, she asked everyone to get out of the car and push. That could be quite embarrassing, especially when all eyes are fixed on you, but yea, it was our solution. In no time, we had pushed the car to its final destination.</p>
		  	<p>Persistence could take you through embarrassing phases, but if you choose not to care about the current phase but the final destination, you will achieve much more than you thought you could.</p>
		  	<p>If she had given in to the fact that there was nothing we could do, that vehicle would never have reached its destination. But as we pushed persistently, we arrived our final destination, even sooner than we imagined.</p>
		  	<p>Likewise, without persistence, no man will reach his destiny; without persistence, no great idea will be established; without persistence, purpose will left unfulfilled; without persistence, we can never go far in life.</p>
		  	<p>The church is the body of Christ; the enemy will always take advantage of every opportunity to attack the church; but as the Church persists all the more in fulfilling the will of God, all plans of the enemy sums up to nullity.</p>
		  	<p>One important virtue portrayed by the early Church is persistence; they never refrained from practicing the good things they had learnt. They never got tired of the Word, they never stopped revering God, they never stopped being united in love, they never stopped fellowshipping and breaking bread, but they persisted all the more.</p>
		  	<p>As it is written, day after day, whether it was raining or snowing, sunny or dry, bright or dark, they never made any excuse not to assemble together with united purpose.</p>
		  	<p>Beloved, persistent men don’t make excuses for refraining. No matter how tight the schedules of the believers were, they put a hold to all other activities and assembled in the temple; No matter how weak and tired they felt in their bodies, they still waxed up and made their way to the temple.</p>
		  	<p>This is not a case of the believers being jobless; each of them had other affairs to take care of, but they prioritized the work of God. Persisting diligently in something does not mean that you have no other issue to handle, but that you have set a priority.</p>
		  	<p>Beloved, start by setting your priorities right; let the will of God define your daily schedules; Let the Word of God direct your path. When this is done, move with all persistence!</p>
		  	<p>Do not think that the early church did not face opposition;. they did! But against all odds, they persisted in doing the will of God.</p>
		  	<p>There will be blocks of opposition, but use them rightly; rather than regarding them as stumbling blocks, use them as stepping stones.</p>
		  	<p>Without persistence, great ideas, dreams and visions die, even before their birth. Don’t silence your purpose by lack of persistence; be ready to move even when your feet are cuffed. Be blessed!</p>
