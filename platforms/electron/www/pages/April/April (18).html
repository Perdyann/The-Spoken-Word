		  	<p><i>And they heard the voice of the Lord God walking in the garden in the cool of the day: and Adam and his wife hid themselves from the presence of the Lord God amongst the trees of the garden. (Genesis 3:8)</i></p>

		  	<blockquote>Anything that is capable of displacing you from the realm of liberty, to that shameful place of captivity should not be tolerated. </blockquote>

		  	<p>I presume the normal reaction of Adam and Eve to the presence of God in the garden is coming out to welcome or greet Him. However, after they had disobeyed, and sinned, they hid themselves from that presence which they previously celebrated. Sin makes God’s presence a dread!</p>
		  	<p>Before the duo disobeyed, they knew not sin, thus, they had full liberty in the presence of God. Righteousness is having a right standing before God, without any feeling of guilt, inferiority or condemnation. Beloved, flee from anything that will makes God’s presence dreadful to you.</p>
		  	<p>Righteousness is the nature of God, which we received in our spirit; in essence, it is a product of the Spirit. The more we feed our spirit daily with the Word of God, the more we are equipped in all righteousness.</p>
		  	<p>We are admonished to come boldly, (and not ashamed) to the throne of grace! (Hebrews 4:16). We shouldn’t let that confidence be stolen. Disobedience stole the confidence Adam and Eve initially had; it pays to obey!</p>
		  	<p>Beloved, it may not necessarily be disobedience; it is an error to deliberately cling unto anything that makes you shameful in God’s presence; such things should be discarded from your life.</p>
		  	<p>When you mingle with an association that defies God’s Word and instruction, you are swapping your confidence with shame.</p>
		  	<p>Disobedience has driven many out of their place in God. It started with Adam and Eve, and continued, even unto Saul. Anything that is capable of displacing you from the realm of liberty, to that shameful place of captivity should not be tolerated.</p>
		  	<p>We are in the era of grace now, but we should not fail to understand that grace can be silenced when it is abused. Paul said,</p>
		  	<p><i>What shall we say then? Shall we continue in sin, that grace may abound?</i></p>
		  	<p><i>God forbid. How shall we, that are dead to sin, live any longer therein? (Romans 6:1-2)</i></p>
		  	<p>Beloved, we are called for greater things. Do not let anything—not disobedience, pride, malice or anything else—hinder you from being able to stand right, without any feeling of guilt, shame or condemnation before God. Be blessed!</p>
