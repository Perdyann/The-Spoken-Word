		  	<p><i>And he had intercourse with Hagar, and she became pregnant; and when she saw that she was with child, she looked with contempt upon her mistress and despised her.</i></p>
		  	<p><i>But Abram said to Sarai, See here, your maid is in your hands and power; do as you please with her. And when Sarai dealt severely with her, humbling and afflicting her, she [Hagar] fled from her.</i></p>
		  	<p><i>But the Angel of the Lord found her by a spring of water in the wilderness on the road to Shur.</i></p>
		  	<p><i>And He said, Hagar, Sarai’s maid, where did you come from, and where are you intending to go? And she said, I am running away from my mistress Sarai.</i></p>
		  	<p><i>The Angel of the Lord said to her, Go back to your mistress and [humbly] submit to her control. (Genesis 16:4 &6-9 AMP)</i></p>


		  	<blockquote>When you intentionally refuse to be broken (humbled), then you’ve bid your blessing goodbye.</blockquote>

		  	<p>Hagar’s pride prompted her mistress, Sarai to be mean to her. When she perceived that she couldn’t cope, she resorted to fleeing from her abode.</p>
		  	<p>It is important to note that when the Angel saw Hagar, in the act of fleeing from Sarah, he did not provide shelter for her; neither did he encourage her to run faster. He told her to go back, and submit!</p>
		  	<p>Indeed, all that was required of Hagar, to dwell in peace with Sarai, was humility and submission.</p>
		  	<p>Likewise, we may also have encountered challenges, which we fled from; but God’s intention is not for us to run away from the mountains, but to tackle it the right way (in faith).</p>
		  	<p>Hagar fled, because Sarai seemed to her like a mountain and threat too hard to comprehend. However, God needed her to go back and learn submission and humility. It is not until the Angel had instructed her thus, that he could release her blessing: <i> Also the Angel of the Lord said to her, I will multiply your descendants exceedingly, so that they shall not be numbered for multitude. (vs.10)</i></p>
		  	<p>Beloved, all that is required of some of us, to receive our blessing, is to go back and act right. Sometimes, God needs to break us in order mould us afresh. When you intentionally refuse to be broken (humbled), then you’ve bid your blessing goodbye.</p>
		  	<p>If it is your attitude, go back and work on it (act rightly); if it is a wrong foundation, go back to it, break it, and re-construct it stronger, so that your building will be well established. It is vain to waste resources, energy and time, building on a wrong foundation.</p>
		  	<p>So often, we run away at the sight of the sea, which we should cross, in order to get to the other side (the promise land). Beloved, we are more than conquerors. We should not act in cowardice, but in readiness to conquer.</p>
		  	<p>Jonah was assigned to fulfil a Divine mandate in Nineveh; just like Hagar, he doubted if he could face the challenges ahead, so he fled to Tarshish. God did not encourage his act of cowardice, but disciplined him, and sent him back to act right.</p>
		  	<p>Jonah eventually had to return to Nineveh. Beloved, when you flee from Divine mandates, it could take you 10 years to get to a place, which you should have reached in one year.</p>
		  	<p>Today, God is telling us to go back to that Divine assignment, which we ran away from, and tackle it wisely; go back to that foundation and re-build it, for the building can never be strong if the foundation is in shambles.</p>
		  	<p>You don’t need to re-visit your past, but there is an un-done assignment you need to accomplish, it’s not too late to get started. Flee not, act right. Be blessed!</p>
