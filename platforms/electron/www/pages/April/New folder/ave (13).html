		  	<p><i>And one of them, when he saw that he was healed, turned back, and with a loud voice glorified God,</i></p>
		  	<p><i>And fell down on his face at his feet, giving him thanks: and he was a Samaritan.</i></p>
		  	<p><i>And Jesus answering said, Were there not ten cleansed? but where are the nine?</i></p>
		  	<p><i>There are not found that returned to give glory to God, save this stranger.</i></p>
		  	<p><i>And he said unto him, Arise, go thy way: thy faith hath made thee whole. (Luke 17:15-19)</i></p>


		  	<blockquote>Wholeness is the best life-insurance policy you could ever opt for. More than God wants the sick healed, he wants them whole. </blockquote>

		  	<p>They were ten lepers, whom God healed; of these very numbers, only one turned back in thanksgiving and glorified God. As a result, he left with something that all others did not receive—wholeness.</p>
		  	<p>Others were healed but not whole, whereas, this fellow, by faith received wholeness as well.</p>
		  	<p>Which is more profitable: Healing or wholeness? Healing restores the physical health alone, but wholeness covers everything. Wholeness is defined as the unbroken completeness of everything, with nothing wanting.</p>
		  	<p>What is left out of everything? Nothing! In essence, nothing can be left wanting, to a man of wholeness. By this, we can conclude that healing is a subset of wholeness.</p>
		  	<p>In essence, by being physically healed, your body is ok, but by being whole, you are made complete in everything—health, prosperity, Wisdom, knowledge, understanding—with nothing wanting.</p>
		  	<p>More than I desire to see the sick receive healing in their bodies, I desire wholeness. Wholeness is assurance that they will never be sick again; wholeness is totality! In essence, by being whole, their life is insured. Wholeness is not just bodily, but spiritual; that is, being equipped in spirit.</p>
		  	<p>The nine lepers received healing in their bodies, and that was all; they’d probably remain spiritual liabilities and financially wretched. But by faith, in thanksgiving, the other leper insured his life by receiving wholeness.</p>
		  	<p>The nine lepers were satisfied with healing; they were too used to the average life; they were comfortable with mediocrity. However, the grateful leper was a man of faith, and his faith fetched him something better than average.</p>
		  	<p>Not many of us have acted differently from the nine lepers. We’ve prayed, and received our break-through, but often forget to be thankful.</p>
		  	<p>Beloved, there is something greater than your previously anticipated break-through, which God still has in store for you. In order for you to receive greater, you have to be thankful.</p>
		  	<p>Don’t be satisfied with healing, go for wholeness. Wholeness is the best life-insurance policy you could ever opt for. More than God wants the sick healed, he wants them whole.</p>
		  	<p>Finally, it is important to understand that our attitude greatly influences what we can receive. With an attitude of gratitude, we can receive something more than what we previously received.</p>
		  	<p>Character has limited many from reaching the heights prepared for them. Build your character in God’s Word! Character could release something more than healing — wholeness — Be blessed!</p>
