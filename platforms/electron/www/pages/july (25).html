		  	<p><i>Be gentle and forbearing with one another and, if one has a difference (a grievance or complaint) against another, readily pardoning each other; even as the Lord has [freely] forgiven you, so must you also [forgive]. (Colossians 3:13 AMP)</i></p>


		  	<blockquote>A heart that does not forgive is not forgiven yet.</blockquote>

		  	<p>To some people, forgiveness is a choice or decision, but to Sons of God, it is a MUST! Reading carefully through the lines of this scripture, we realize that we are not admonished or encouraged to forgive, but reminded that forgiveness is something we must do.</p>
		  	<p>When you forgive someone, you not only do the person a favor, but yourself as well.</p>
		  	<p>When I was a child, I got offended by people quite often; to those who apologized, I easily forgave, but to some others I said, “I will never forgive you.”</p>
		  	<p>Now looking at that sentence I once made, “I will never forgive you”, it is obvious that I did not understand anything about forgiveness at that time. I always thought that by forgiving someone, I was doing the person a favor, until I realized that by forgiving someone, I am favoring and liberating myself.</p>
		  	<p>This scripture as well as the Lord’s Prayer likens our act of forgiveness to the forgiveness freely given by the Father. Indeed, if the Father can freely forgive us for whatsoever we have done, we have no justification to withhold forgiveness from our neighbors.</p>
		  	<p>Furthermore, we say the Lord’s Prayer so often; when we do, we never omit the line that states, <i> “forgive us our trespasses as we forgive those who trespass against us.” </i> By so doing, we have deliberately pronounced that the Lord should forgive us just in the same manner as we forgive our trespassers.</p>
		  	<p>This fully portrays that a heart that does not forgive is not forgiven yet. Just as much as you want the Lord to remember your flaws no more, you also should not hold your neighbors by their flaws.</p>
		  	<p>We are freely forgiven by God; therefore, we should freely forgive one another.</p>
		  	<p>When you constantly bear grudges against people, you are in no way affecting them, but yourself; your mind gets too heavy, that you cannot run the Divine race freely.</p>
		  	<p>If the state of your mind determines the course of your life; and if grudges get your mind too heavy; it can be concluded that by bearing grudges, your life is headed on a wrong course.</p>
		  	<p>You ease and liberate yourself, whenever you decide to forgive. Beloved, set your life on the right course simply by choosing to have a free mind. Do yourself this single favor — forgive!</p>
