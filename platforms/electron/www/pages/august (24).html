		  	<p><i>And saith unto them, Go your way into the village over against you: and as soon as ye be entered into it, ye shall find a colt tied, whereon never man sat; loose him, and bring him.</i></p>
		  	<p><i>And if any man say unto you, Why do ye this? say ye that the Lord hath need of him; and straightway he will send him hither. (Mark 11:2-3)</i></p>

		  	<blockquote>Solutions pre-exist problems. If there was no solution, the problem will never arise.</blockquote>

		  	<p>When God speaks a Word, the storms roar to test our faith; it was not until Jesus spoke a Word to Peter, telling him to walk on the water with Him, that the storms began to roar. Verily, what attracted the storm was the spoken Word of God.</p>
		  	<p>Whenever the Lord releases a message, oppositions arise to hinder it; the disciples faced oppositions while trying to untie the colt, because they were acting on a Divine message.</p>
		  	<p>It is amazing to comprehend the fact that even before Jesus sent His disciples to bring the colt, he already knew that they were going encounter an opposition, thus, He gave them the tips on how to handle it. Verily, God knows the oppositions you will face even before you encounter them.</p>
		  	<p>Jesus spelt out the solution to the opposition, even before they encountered it; verily, solutions pre-exist problems. If there was no solution, the problem will never arise.</p>
		  	<p>Notice, the disciples had to hear Jesus clearly before departing from Him; that’s why, when they encountered oppositions, they handled it just as He told them to. Likewise beloved, it is important that you hear God in clarity before commencing any mission.</p>
		  	<p>The reason why you’ve not been able to handle the oppositions you faced is probably because you never heard God clearly before you proceeded. Starting a mission, without direction will leave you stranded in your commotion.</p>
		  	<p>Furthermore, it is important to note that every opposition is an opportunity to portray the glory of God. When the disciples encountered oppositions while trying to untie the colt, they took advantage of it, to tell of the Savior, Jesus.</p>
		  	<p>There was a reason why God allowed Daniel to face such great oppositions, which led him into the lion’s den. There was a reason why God allowed Shedrach, Meshach and Abednego to be casted into the fire of oppression; it all happened to glorify the name of the Lord.</p>
		  	<p>If it was not for the glory of God, He wouldn’t have allowed Lazarus to die; He wouldn’t have allowed Paul and Silas to be chained and imprisoned; He wouldn’t have allowed Joseph to be sold.</p>
		  	<p>Stop regarding oppositions as hindrances, but as opportunities; that is what they are. What was supposed to be an opposition to them became an opportunity for them.</p>
		  	<p>Beloved, only God makes an opportunity out of every opposition; with God, what was supposed to be a tragedy, turns out a testimony; what was supposed to be a problem, turns out a promise; what was supposed to be a mistake, turns out a miracle; what was supposed to be a mess, turns out a message.</p>
		  	<p>It is amazing how the Lord creates opportunities from our oppositions. The solution to today’s opposition was made available since yesterday. Cheer up! The Lord will turn everything around for your good. Be blessed!</p>
