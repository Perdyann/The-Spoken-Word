		  <div class="panel-body" style="text-align:justify">


		  	<p><i>Lay not up for yourselves treasures upon earth, where moth and rust doth corrupt, and where thieves break through and steal:</i></p>
		  	<p><i>But lay up for yourselves treasures in heaven, where neither moth nor rust doth corrupt, and where thieves do not break through nor steal:</i></p>
		  	<p><i>For where your treasure is, there will your heart be also. (Matthew 6:19-21)</i></p>
		

		  	<blockquote>Until you get devoted to your Divine purpose and assignment, you are barely saving up treasures that really won’t count.</blockquote>

		  	<p>He was only walking down the stairs in the morning, feeling a slight headache, which made him weak and tipsy. No farther had he gone, when he suddenly slumped and gave up the ghost. It was the end! As friends and families gathered to mourn and gaze at his strength-less body; there laid his phone, ringing with no one to answer it. Then this thought flooded my heart... Earthly treasures are vanity!</p>
		  	<p>There are treasures we get that can be carried with us, even after our demise. Likewise, some treasures end after our lives. There are names that outlive a man; likewise, some men outlive their names. Martin Luther King died, but his name lives on.</p>
		  	<p>As divine as spiritual gifts are, they are earthly. There is no one that needs to be healed in heaven. The gift of healing, prophecy, amongst others will cease when the earth passes away. But the Word of God will forever endure, in heaven and on earth.</p>
		  	<p>Like never before, we are admonished to lay up everlasting treasures rather than earthly and perishable ones alone. Earthly treasures could be devoured, corrupt or destroyed, but spiritual treasures are indestructible.</p>
		  	<p>There are things that could be stolen from a man; likewise, there are things that remain indestructible. Joseph’s brothers could seize all he had; they could rip him off his physical treasures. He was bound and imprisoned. They could hand-cuff and chain his physical body, but they were never able to chain his dream and visions. These were the very things that ushered him into his destiny.</p>
		  	<p>The real things that ushers a man into high places cannot be misplaced. Many writers have lost their written inspiration by losing the computer in which they were saved, but that didn’t stop the real writers from writing even greater things with much passion. The wisdom of God in a man is hidden in the heart, and expressed through writing, thus, even when the written materials are destroyed, the wisdom can still speak.</p>
		  	<p>Never be discouraged and depressed by the loss of anything. Always bear in mind that your real treasures and potentials are indestructible. Like Joseph, never let go of your dreams and visions, because of a temporal loss and persecution.</p>
		  	<p>The Word for today is concluded by this sentence, <i> “For where your treasure is, there will your heart be also” </i> Today, I’d ask you one question... “Where is your heart?” The answer to this question will reveal the path in which you currently stand.</p>
		  	<p>Is your heart devoted to the vain pursuit of perishable titles, materials and achievements, or are you really devoted to fulfilling your purpose in God. Until you get devoted to your Divine purpose and assignment, you are barely saving up treasures that really won’t count. More grace!</p>
