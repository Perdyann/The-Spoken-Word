		  	<p><i>Before I formed thee in the belly I knew thee; and before thou camest forth out of the womb I sanctified thee, and I ordained thee a prophet unto the nations. (Jeremiah 1:5)</i></p>
		  	


		  	<blockquote>He that deliberately refuses to be transformed intentionally denies usefulness. </blockquote>

		  	<p>I have done several things in life which I regretted. The most painful thing in life, as most people believe, is regret. It is that feeling that makes you want to go back in time, and change some previous actions. What makes it more painful is the fact that the clock ticks forward rather than backward. Thus, our deeds cannot be undone.</p>
		  	<p>However, the forward-ticking of the clock, makes it more pleasant for me. Too many people are too focused on their past mistakes that they cannot step into the next phase of their lives.</p>
		  	<p>At times when I felt so terrible about what I had done... At times when I felt that I had offended God beyond reconciliation... At times when it seemed like I had prompted the wrath of God... At times when it was obvious that I had fallen short of the glory of God... This one thing did I remember — He first knew me —</p>
		  	<p>Before God calls, chooses, sanctifies and ordains a man, He must have known that man—His weaknesses, his capacity, what he is capable of doing, the mistakes he is liable to make, amongst others—</p>
		  	<p>If indeed He knew us, before He formed us, then He will not abandon us, for making the mistakes, which He knew that we were liable to make.</p>
		  	<p>God chose us despite the fact that we weren’t qualified, because He doesn’t choose the perfect, but perfects the chosen. It is written,</p>
		  	<p><i>But God hath chosen the foolish things of the world to confound the wise; and God hath chosen the weak things of the world to confound the things which are mighty; (1 Corinthians 1:27)</i></p>
		  	<p>Nevertheless, we must understand that God didn’t chose us, in order to use us the way we are; He chose us the way we are, in order to transform us to what he wants us to become. He that deliberately refuses to be transformed intentionally denies usefulness.</p>
		  	<p>As we meditate on the Word of God daily, and pray with an open heart, in readiness to hearken and receive, we are being transformed into God’s own image. Refusal to align your life to God’s Word, limits you to being who you were, and not what God desires you to be.</p>
		  	<p>Beloved, before God sent Jesus to the earth to carry the cross, He foreknew that Jesus would fall while carrying the cross; nevertheless, Jesus always rose with strength, and continued with passion.</p>
		  	<p>In all things brethren, never be discouraged by your fall, God foreknew that you were always liable to fall, even before He sent you. However, always rise up with a renewed strength, and passion to reach your destination. Be blessed.</p>
