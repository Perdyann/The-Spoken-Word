		  	<p><i>“... and the Lord kept adding [to their number] daily those who were being saved [from spiritual death].” (Acts 2:47b)</i></p>

		  	<blockquote>When a man discovers God, and walk in his ways, increase becomes inevitable.</blockquote>

		  	<p>The world has been posed with different occurrences and changes in terms of policies, rules and principles. In most cases, these have been in favor of big companies, personalities and dignitaries, but the smaller ones are neglected, lagging behind and seeking recognition.</p>
		  	<p>Every organization or body of individuals is seeking growth and increase; rural areas seek urbanization; local businesses seek globalization; everyone is after increase.</p>
		  	<p>However, there is one thing we must understand; when a man discovers God, and walk in his ways, increase becomes inevitable. The early church increased, but that did not just happen, until they had persistently and devotedly sold themselves to God.</p>
		  	<p>Notice that increase was the last thing to be mentioned in that chapter. The writer had to expressly state the devotions first, before the reward. In essence, it was their extent of devotion that made room for increase.</p>
		  	<p>Recently, we have had a study about the Early Church, with respect to the different virtues portrayed by them.</p>
		  	<p>They were not just devoted to the Word, but reverential to God; they were not just united by their commonalities, but sacrificially loving; they were not just persistent in doing these, but summed it up with praise. As they continued in faith, God increased their numbers.</p>
		  	<p>Beloved, our search for increase should be termed found, as a result of this scripture; the key to increase is pronounced by the exhibitions of the Early Church.</p>
		  	<p>Verily, there is no church, organization or body, which is totally devoted to God in all reverence, united in love, and persistent in praise, to whom, increase will be withheld.</p>
		  	<p>In order for God to increase you, you need to make room for that increase. God will not add more to your number, when there is not even enough to sustain what you have.</p>
		  	<p>Make room for increase by embracing these virtues; be devoted to learning the Word. Revere God. Be united. Show love and sacrifice. Remain persistent. Praise God in all seasons. Increase awaits thee!</p>
		  	<p>God is ever willing to give more to those who have containers to receive. You cannot expect God to increase the content when the container cannot hold any more.</p>
		  	<p>If you want increase, prepare yourself for it. I am very certain that when you’ve made room to contain, God will add to your number. Be blessed!</p>
