		  	<p><i>Thy servant slew both the lion and the bear: and this uncircumcised Philistine shall be as one of them, seeing he hath defied the armies of the living God. (1 Samuel 17:36)</i></p>


		  	<blockquote>If you are not confident enough to face the present challenge, you cannot be worthy of the glory ahead.</blockquote>

		  	<p>David might never have been so confident about defeating Goliath if he had not defeated the bear and lion. The bear and lion were challenges that stretched his faith, and the confidence of Saul towards him.</p>
		  	<p>It was not until he told Saul what he had done to the bear and lion, that Saul became confident that he could handle Goliath in like manner.</p>
		  	<p>Challenges reveal your innate abilities; if you’ve never encountered a fierce challenge, you might never know how much power and strength you have within.</p>
		  	<p>If a challenge cannot stretch you, then it is not a challenge. I am glad when I’m posed with challenges of diverse kinds; they reveal my greatness in different spheres.</p>
		  	<p>If you never take a step, you can never walk a mile; if you never write a word, you can never write a book; if you never confront the lion, you can never defeat the giant.</p>
		  	<p>The lion and bear are the initial challenges that stretch and enhance your ability to defeat the giant. Without such challenges, you can never be stretched to achieve or accomplish anything great in life.</p>
		  	<p>Stretch! Don’t be too excited that you’ve defeated the bear; the lion is on its way. Don’t be satisfied by the defeat of the bear and lion, go for the giant. There is glory at the end of every challenge, stretch!</p>
		  	<p>When the bear and lion approached David, he did not flee, he confronted them. If you flee at the sight of every challenge, your potentials remain locked within you, and your extent of success becomes limited. Embrace the challenge, and allow it to reveal your extent of greatness.</p>
		  	<p>If gold is not tested in the fire, it would never be valued as original. If it had not been for the challenges David went through, he never would have realized his worth. Likewise, if you are not confident enough to face the present challenge, you cannot be worthy of the glory ahead.</p>
		  	<p>Quit fleeing from things that are presented to reveal your greatness. Every man born of God is able and great; sometimes, it takes challenges to reveal our greatness and abilities.</p>
		  	<p>Challenges are not made to suppress you, but to stretch your faith. Be blessed!</p>
