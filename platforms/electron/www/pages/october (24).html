		  	<p><i>For consider your calling, brothers: not many of you were wise according to worldly standards, not many were powerful, not many were of noble birth.</i></p>
		  	<p><i>But God chose what is foolish in the world to shame the wise; God chose what is weak in the world to shame the strong; </i></p>
		  	<p><i>God chose what is low and despised in the world, even things that are not, to bring to nothing things that are, so that no human being might boast in the presence of God. (1 Corinthians 26-29 ESV)</i></p>

		  	<blockquote>Our qualification is not given by our fulfillment of worldly standards, but of God, who approves the disqualified. </blockquote>

		  	<p>God has never chosen a qualified person; we might not have been wise, we might not have been influential or powerful, we might not have been from recognized families or backgrounds; but God still chose us.</p>
		  	<p>David was not qualified to join the army, but the anointing of God qualified him to defeat Goliath. Isn’t it amazing that what the world could never qualify us for, the anointing of God can?</p>
		  	<p>According to worldly standards, we were weak, foolish and despised, but by the grace, mercy and favor of God, we have received the wisdom and strength of God.</p>
		  	<p>The grace of God can easily grant you things that the world could never count you worthy of. Therefore, make a conscious choice to be defined by God, and not the world.</p>
		  	<p>Joseph’s family members were the first people to attempt killing his dreams. His brothers were willing to go to any extent to ensure that his dreams were nullified.</p>
		  	<p>Despite the judgments of his brothers against him, God still chose him for greatness. Likewise, despite the judgment of the world, you can still be great. Our qualification is not given by our fulfillment of worldly standards, but of God, who approves the disqualified.</p>
		  	<p>If God has not disqualified you yet, don’t give up; don’t wait for the approval of the world, before you know that you are called and chosen.</p>
		  	<p>Consider your call, and magnify the Lord. Who are we that He is mindful of us? We don’t deserve anything, yet He gave us the best.</p>
		  	<p>However, we must understand that He did this for no other reason than having no human being boast in His presence. We are not here by our strength, ability, wisdom, influence or reputable background; but by His grace, mercy and favor.</p>
		  	<p>Boast not beloved, we are nothing in ourselves, but everything in God; let us therefore glorify Him in everything. Consider your calling, and give God the glory. Be blessed!</p>
