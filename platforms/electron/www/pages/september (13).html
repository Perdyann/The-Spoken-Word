		  	<p><i>And he said unto them, The sabbath was made for man, and not man for the sabbath:</i></p>
		  	<p><i>Therefore the Son of man is Lord also of the sabbath. (Mark 2:27-28)</i></p>
		  	

		  	<blockquote>Favor grants you an access that faithfulness to protocol can never give. You are the favored of the Lord; forget about the rules, and stir your faith.</blockquote>

		  	<p>The Sabbath is a day characterized by its do’s and don’ts. Things which are ordinarily accepted are not accepted on the Sabbath day. It is a day filled with so much protocols, rules and laws.</p>
		  	<p>So often, people are carried away, acting out those rules that they fail to realize that they were not made for the rules, but the rules for them.</p>
		  	<p>When the disciples of Jesus were criticized for their actions of plucking ears of corn on the Sabbath day, Jesus clearly stated that the Sabbath was made in favor of man, and not against him.</p>
		  	<p>Likewise beloved, it is time we realize that the rules are not made to subject us, but to be our subjects. Any principle or protocol, which you cannot reign over, is not for you. Being born-again gives us an edge over earthly principles and protocols.</p>
		  	<p>The worst mistake a man can make is to spend his entire life, being shaped by worldly rules and protocols, which were made to be subject to his words. Until you understand that protocols are your subjects and not your guide, you will remain a servant, who should have been a king.</p>
		  	<p>We have the ability to define the rules; to change it, and to break it when necessary. The woman with the issue of blood broke the queuing protocol; Esther broke a protocol to fulfill purpose; sometimes, protocols are made to be broken and not fully observed.</p>
		  	<p>I recall the instance of the man, by the pool, who was paralyzed for thirty eight years. At that season, there was a protocol observed to obtain healing—when the storms were stirred, only the first person to jump into the pool, received healing.</p>
		  	<p>However, Jesus healed this man out of sympathy, not minding the protocols that were to be observed.</p>
		  	<p>At another instance, the friends of a paralyzed man broke the protocol of entering a house through the door, and windows only, when their faith propelled them to let their friend down through the roof.</p>
		  	<p>Beloved they received something that everyone else could not get; they came quite late . . . some people arrived before them, but Jesus did not operate on the protocol of first come, first serve. No! He was more moved by their faith, than he was by their faithfulness in observing protocol.</p>
		  	<p>Likewise brethren, be more faith-conscious, than protocol-conscious. Be led by your faith, and not the protocols involved; for when faith comes to play, all protocols are divinely broken.</p>
		  	<p>Favor grants you an access that faithfulness to protocol can never give. You are the favored of the Lord; forget about the rules, and stir your faith. Be blessed!</p>
