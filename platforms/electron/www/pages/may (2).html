		  	<p><i>He answered and said unto them, Give ye them to eat. And they say unto him, Shall we go and buy two hundred pennyworth of bread, and give them to eat?</i></p>
		  	<p><i>He saith unto them, How many loaves have ye? go and see. And when they knew, they say, Five, and two fishes. (Mark 6:37-38)</i></p>

		  	<blockquote>When the anointing of God comes upon the little, it satisfies great needs. When you look clearly into the rejected stone you have, you will realize that it is indeed diamond.</blockquote>

		  	<p>There is something very significant about the feeding of the multitude, consisting over five thousand people, with just five loaves of bread and two fish.</p>
		  	<p>When Jesus wanted to bless them, He did not call down bread and fish from heaven, but made a blessing out of the little they had. He asked them, “How many loaves have ye?” It took the disciples, recognizing what they had, in order to be blessed.</p>
		  	<p>Beloved, meditating through the scriptures, I realized various similar instances. In all these, people were only blessed through the recognition of what they had, no matter how little and insignificant it seemed.</p>
		  	<p>In 1 King 17, in a time of famine, Elijah had commanded the widow to get him cake. Despite the fact that she had no cake, she was still able to recognize the little she had. She said, <i> “I have not a cake, but an handful of meal in a barrel, and a little oil in a cruse:” (vs. 12). </i> Some people will outrightly tell the Prophet, “I have nothing!” but this widow recognized what she had. Indeed, the blessing came through the little she had.</p>
		  	<p>Elisha had a similar encounter with a widow,</p>
		  	<p><i>And Elisha said unto her, What shall I do for thee? tell me, what hast thou in the house? And she said, Thine handmaid hath not any thing in the house, save a pot of oil. (2 Kings 4:2)</i></p>
		  	<p>Elisha did not proclaim a blessing on the widow until he was sure she had something to be blessed. God does not release empty blessings; for Him to bless you, you’ve got to recognize what you have.</p>
		  	<p>The widow’s pot of oil was nothing compared to the debt she had to pay. Despite the fact that this widow knew she had nothing really valuable, she still did not fail to recognize her little pot of oil. Verily the blessing, which settled her debts and all her needs, came through that little pot of oil.</p>
		  	<p>When Jesus needed to provide wine for the wedding at Cana, He did not pronounce the blessings on the empty jars; He ensured that they were first filled with something (water). Yea, they didn’t have wine, but they had water . . . there had to be water for the blessing of wine to be released. Beloved, you have to recognize what you have, in order for God to give you what you desire.</p>
		  	<p>The entire message today is summarized in the truth that we should never look down on what we have; we should never fail to recognize things, no matter how invaluable they seem. When the anointing of God comes upon the little, it satisfies great needs.</p>
		  	<p>Five loaves of bread and two fish seemed like nothing, but when the anointing of God came upon it, it satisfied a multitude, with leftovers.</p>
		  	<p>The widow’s handful of meal was nothing really, but when the anointing of God came upon it. It served them many days.</p>
		  	<p>The widow’s pot of oil was nothing valuable, but when the blessing of God rested on it, it filled many jars and settled her debts.</p>
		  	<p>Water was not what was needed, but when the blessing of God came on it, it was transformed to the best wine ever.</p>
		  	<p>Beloved, the resources you have on you now might not be anything compared to the project ahead, but what matters most is the blessing and anointing of God upon it. Rather than regard what you have as insignificant, declare God’s blessings upon it. It is written:</p>
		  	<p><i>For whosoever hath, to him shall be given, and he shall have more abundance: but whosoever hath not, from him shall be taken away even that he hath. (Matthew 13:12)</i></p>
		  	<p>Beloved, this scripture rightly states that in having shall you have more, and in nothing, shall what you have be taken from you. I believe that if the widows had denied having anything at all, the little they had would have been taken from them. However, by recognizing what they had, they received it in more abundance.</p>
		  	<p>Value what you have; value the helpers in your Ministry; value whatsoever it is God has given you. When you look clearly into the rejected stone you have, you will realize that it is indeed diamond.</p>
		  	<p>Never regard anyone or anything as insignificant; never mistreat anyone you think you don’t need. The blessing often comes through unexpected means; be careful so that you don’t miss out on it. What do you have? Please don’t say ‘nothing’; Be blessed!</p>
