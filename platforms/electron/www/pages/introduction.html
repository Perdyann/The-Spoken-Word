				<p>The world was created by the Words of God; whenever there was an utterance, life was birthed! In the midst of darkness, formlessness and disorder, God spoke light, shape, and order. The creation of the earth and all that is within is a manifestation of the Spoken Words of God. There is something about utterances, which brings into existence things that are not as though they were.</p>
				<p>However, in order for the Word to be spoken, it has to be deposited richly in the spirit of man. You cannot speak of that, which you know nothing about. The world is passing away and all that is within; nevertheless, one thing is constant — The Word!</p>
				<p>The Word of God can be viewed from two different perspectives — the Written Word, and the Spoken Word. The written Word of God is “logos”, but the Spoken Word of God is “Rhema”</p>
				<p>There is only so much the "logos" can do; the power to transform is in the utterance — Rhema! When God spoke to the earth, great transformation occurred!</p>
				<p>Jesus told His disciples that if they speak to any mountain in faith, it will be uprooted and cast into the sea; Beloved, in order for the mountains to be moved, there has to be an utterance in faith.</p>
				<p>Until you begin to receive the Word of God as Rhema, you have not started profiting from it yet. Rhema translates the Word to the personal experiences of man, and embeds within him the power to overcome.</p>
				<p>The Spoken Word is 365 days daily devotional, comprising shared revelation and insights in the Word of God, carefully written by the inspiration of the Holy Spirit, to impart the Word of God in the hearts of men.</p>
				<p>In this book the Author quotes,</p>
				<p><i>“The only things you don’t have today are the things you never said yesterday. The brightness of the future is determined by the faith-filled words of the present day.”</i></p>
				<p>As you commence this insightful meditation of the Word of God, prepare your mind to receive all that the Spirit will deposit in you, and declare it always. Your best days are ahead of you! Be blessed!</p>
