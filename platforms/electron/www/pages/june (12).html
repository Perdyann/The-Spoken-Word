		  	<p><i>But now, O LORD, thou art our father; we are the clay, and thou our potter; and we all are the work of thy hand. (Isaiah 64:8)</i></p>


		  	<blockquote>Not everyone is destined to reach the heights you are destined to reach. </blockquote>

		  	<p>Just as the potter has molded the clay into different forms to suit different purposes, God has made us differently to suit our purposes. You cannot have a perfect relationship with everyone when you always expect them to be just like you.</p>
		  	<p>We should learn to appreciate people for who they are; I have my strengths as well as weakness; the way I do things is very different from the way other people do them. The last thing I will try to do is to impose my ways on someone else, because we are just not the same.</p>
		  	<p>My greatest strength might be the weakness of someone else, and vice versa. It is good to watch out for one another; it is good to try and help people out in their weaknesses; it is good to pray for one another; but most importantly, we should always let God be the potter.</p>
		  	<p>Each purpose has its requirement, and God has carefully designed us to suit our purposes. Some people are courageous while others are timid; some are outspoken, while others are a bit reserved; some are lively while others are monotonous; the list goes on.</p>
		  	<p>Some students get prepared for an exam months before the date, but some others just start reading hours or days before. Most often, the results of the exam is not solely dependent on the time of preparation; the people who prepare late may have reasons for doing so just as well as those who prepare early. We all have our differences!</p>
		  	<p>The fact that I fast five days in a week does not mean that everyone else should do same. Sometimes, when we encounter people that do not fast as often as we do, or do things in the way we do them, we tend to make them feel as though they are not good enough. When will we realize that each calling has got different requirements?</p>
		  	<p>The way you are suits your purpose just as the well as the way your brother is suits his own purpose. The difference is not in you both, but in your purposes.</p>
		  	<p>Why was Joseph more of a dreamer than his brothers? His destiny was different from theirs’; not everyone is destined to reach the heights you are destined to reach.</p>
		  	<p>God declares in Jeremiah 18:6, <i> “ ... as the clay is in the potter’s hand, so are ye in mine hand, O house of Israel.”</i></p>
		  	<p>There is no clay pot the potter cannot break and re-mold; likewise, there is no weakness or situation the Lord cannot deal with. Allow God to be the potter!</p>
		  	<p>We should learn to appreciate people for who they are; don’t try to make people feel that they are not good enough by constantly spelling out their weaknesses to them; if you really care about their weaknesses, handle it with care, and pray for them. God is the potter; He will re-mold them if the change is necessary.</p>
		  	<p>The world will be a better place if we stop capitalizing on the weaknesses of people, and start appreciating their strengths.</p>
		  	<p>Don’t try to mold people to the figure you want them to be; they were not made to suit your needs, but a Divine purpose. Allow God to be the Potter. Be blessed!</p>
