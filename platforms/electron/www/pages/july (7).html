		  	<p><i>For I will promote thee unto very great honour, and I will do whatsoever thou sayest unto me: come therefore, I pray thee, curse me this people.</i></p>
		  	<p><i>And Balaam answered and said unto the servants of Balak, If Balak would give me his house full of silver and gold, I cannot go beyond the word of the LORD my God, to do less or more. (Numbers 22:17-18)</i></p>
		


		  	<blockquote>No offer is worth your compromise; no man has the ability to make you anything greater than what God has already made you. </blockquote>

		  	<p>If there is a price or offer that’s capable of getting you enticed, and buying you over, then you’re not yet ready for a walk in God. Great men have proven by their stands, how priceless they are.</p>
		  	<p>Even after Balaam had made it known to Balak that the Lord has commanded him not to fulfil his request of cursing the people of Israel, Balak still persuaded, and tried to entice him with gifts, so that he might deny God, and act contrary to His instructions.</p>
		  	<p>It is amazing how Balaam responded to the proposal of Balak. By his statement, he insinuated that no offer, not even the best material treasure, could ever make him act contrary to the Word of God.</p>
		  	<p>Not many people would have responded the way Balaam did; many have already denied and disobeyed God for fame and material treasures; many have compromised their stands for the enticement of sugar-coated offers.</p>
		  	<p>Balak promised to promote Balaam unto very great honor; but then I wondered, “What greater honor is there than being in the Lord?” Verily, the world has nothing to offer you; everything you are enticed with by the world, are things you already have, but don’t know about.</p>
		  	<p>The devil tempted Jesus; he tried to entice Him with wealth and fame; he persuaded Jesus, the Son of God, to only bow and worship him and he will in turn offer Him the whole world. But Jesus knew His worth. He understood that the very things He was tempted with are rightfully His.</p>
		  	<p>To what extent will you stand true to the Word of God? To what extent will you turn down offers, for the sake of your stand in God? Balaam proved that he was priceless. He proved that no amount of worldly treasures could buy him over, from the side of God.</p>
		  	<p>Today, I want to ask, “What is your price?” Until you take off that price tag, you remain devalued.</p>
		  	<p>Balaam understood that he was worth more than Balak could ever offer. Jesus understood that he was worth more than anything the devil could offer. Do you understand your worth? No offer is worth your compromise. None at all!</p>
		  	<p>Beloved, no man has the ability to make you anything greater than what God has already made you. You only need to discover your identity in God, and you will realize how petty the offers of the world are to you.</p>
		  	<p>You are much more than the world can offer. Be blessed!</p>
