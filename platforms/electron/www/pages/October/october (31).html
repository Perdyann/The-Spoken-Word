		  	<p><i>Having a form of godliness, but denying the power thereof: from such turn away.</i></p>
		  	<p><i>For of this sort are they which creep into houses, and lead captive silly women laden with sins, led away with divers lusts,</i></p>
		  	<p><i>Ever learning, and never able to come to the knowledge of the truth. (2 Timothy 3:5-7)</i></p>
		 

		  	<blockquote>Weaknesses and lack of discernment makes a man prone to disguised dangers.</blockquote>

		  	<p>Beware of wolves in sheep clothing; these are pretentious people, with an outward appearance, portraying them as sheep, whereas, they are wolves with evil and destructive intentions.</p>
		  	<p>These fellows have a form of godliness; judging from their outward appearance and conduct, you can easily conclude that they are devoted to God; yet, they refuse to let the ‘devotion’ change the way they live.</p>
		  	<p>The crazy thing about wolves in sheep clothing is that they can only take advantage of weak and ignorant people, who are not aware of their hidden motives.</p>
		  	<p>As the scripture portrays, these fellows creep and sneak into houses to lead silly and weak women astray. Notice, the women led astray are not strong, discerning and watchful; but weak, silly and sinful in all diverse lusts.</p>
		  	<p>These women will listen to anybody who will teach them; they are not discerning enough! Over years, they have only compiled wrong information, which has blinded them, lest they realize the knowledge of truth.</p>
		  	<p>The only advantage these pretentious fellows (wolves in sheep clothing) have over these women is their weakness, silliness, sinful nature, and lack of discernment. It is obvious that weaknesses and lack of discernment makes a man prone to disguised dangers.</p>
		  	<p>We are in the last days; many wolves are emerging in disguise. Without discernment, we really can’t distinguish between the wolves and the sheep.</p>
		  	<p>Having a complete knowledge of the truth that the only advantage these disguised wolves have over anyone is their weakness and silliness, what manner of persons ought we to be?</p>
		  	<p>Except you are continually strengthened and established in the Word, except you grow in Spirit and discernment, and except you are transformed by the renewal of your mind, you remain prone to the attacks of disguised wolves.</p>
		  	<p>Stop languishing in that sinful, weak and silly nature; stop allowing disguised wolves to rule over you; embrace the light of God’s Word, and be made strong and fully equipped. Be blessed!</p>
