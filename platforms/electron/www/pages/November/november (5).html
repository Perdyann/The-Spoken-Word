		  	<p><i>Have mercy upon me, O God, according to thy lovingkindness: according unto the multitude of thy tender mercies blot out my transgressions. (Psalm 51:1)</i></p>

		  	<blockquote>I have seen an apology bring calmness and peace to the most conflicting atmosphere.</blockquote>

		  	<p>In a season when kings usually went to battle, David decided to rest; In the process of his relaxation, he committed adultery; in an attempt to cover up his wrongs, he committed murder. David committed so many blunders within a short period.</p>
		  	<p>Initially, he tried to hide his deeds by getting rid of Uriah; he succeeding in hiding it from men, but failed to realize that nothing can be hidden from God.</p>
		  	<p>This scripture is an excerpt of the Psalm written by David, after he was confronted for his abominable deeds by Prophet Nathan. As soon as the Prophet finished speaking with him, he realized the magnitude of the offence he had committed, and immediately sought mercy from God.</p>
		  	<p>David made a mistake like a normal man would, but he was quick to apologize for his wrongs as soon as he realized them. Thus, the Lord was merciful unto him, even though he still disciplined him.</p>
		  	<p>Sorry is often referred to as the ‘magic word’ because it ushers peace in the most conflicting environment.</p>
		  	<p>I recall many years ago, when I had a serious brawl with my brother. We were pretty young then . . . It was a rainy day, when my brother returned home, knocking at the gate. He was desperate to get into the house because the rain was getting heavier, but I was inside the house, too occupied that I couldn’t hear a sound.</p>
		  	<p>Eventually, I heard someone knocking, and rushed to open the door, but he began to yell at me, being soaked in the rain for too long. All he wanted to hear at that point was the magic word, but I just wouldn’t say that word, because I didn’t think I was wrong.</p>
		  	<p>The damage caused by our fight is something that took time to heal; it is amazing how well that word works.</p>
		  	<p>Previously, when people raised their voices at me, I always thought that the best response was to shout back at them, but that often led to grievous conflicts. In no time, I realized a better approach—apology! I have seen an apology bring calmness and peace to the most conflicting atmosphere.</p>
		  	<p>There are times when the Lord spoke to me, and I acted contrary to His Words; with a broken spirit I uttered, “I am sorry Lord ...” David had obviously done wrong, he had fallen short of the glory of God, but what did he do? He simply showed the Lord how sorry he was. What does it take to apologize for your wrongs?</p>
		  	<p>Life would be more peaceful if everyone could learn to use the magic word. Sometimes, even when I am quite certain that I’m not wrong; I’d still apologize for the sake of peace.</p>
		  	<p>Sorry does not cost anything! People have kept malice for many years, borne grudges for too long, carried weights and burdens unnecessarily, simply because they’re too proud to apologize.</p>
		  	<p>Apologizing does not mean that you are at fault, neither does it mean that you are weak; it only proves the extent of your maturity. Never get too proud to apologize. Be blessed!</p>
