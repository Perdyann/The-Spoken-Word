		  <div class="panel-body" style="text-align:justify">


		  	<p><i>Therefore, my dearly beloved, shun (keep clear away from, avoid by flight if need be) any sort of idolatry (of loving or venerating anything more than God). (1 Corinthians 10:14 AMP)</i></p>
		  	

		  	<blockquote>No man has the capacity to stand as your last hope.</blockquote>

		  	<p>So often, when we study such passages that admonish us to flee idolatry, the image we envisage is that of a physical structure or object, which is being worshiped and prostrated to, as a god.</p>
		  	<p>However, the use of idolatry in this context differs from that, which we so often envisage. An idol is a person or thing that is extremely admired, loved or revered (more than God, in this context).</p>
		  	<p>When you wake up in the morning, the first person you should communicate and fellowship with is the Holy Spirit. In times of trouble, the refuge, to which you should run, is the arms of God.</p>
		  	<p>If in any case, the first thing you do when you get up in the morning is to tweet, “friends, I’m up ...”, or perhaps switch on the television, radio, or anything else, you are gradually making your twitter account, television and radio channels your idol.</p>
		  	<p>If in times of trouble, the only refuge you can run to is your friends, colleagues, or boss (the arms of flesh), then you are gradually making them your idol. Some people even say, when greatly distressed, “Help me please... you are my last hope” That is highly erroneous! No man has the capacity to stand as your last hope.</p>
		  	<p>Another trending idol, I have seen is phones; they are very good, but if care is not taken, they become idols. A colleague once said to me, “Whenever I’m bored, I spend hours on my phone without realizing.” How is it that hours, which cannot ordinarily be spent in the presence of God, is invested in browsing through a mere phone, chatting and texting?</p>
		  	<p>Anything you love, show more attention to, dedicate more time to, or venerate more than God is an idol. Flee from it; as the passage rightly states, “fight it if need be.”</p>
		  	<p>Beloved, we have ignorantly turned the social media, phones and even people into our idols. The scripture today admonishes us to flee from every form of idolatry.</p>
		  	<p>Men have become lovers of pleasure, more than lovers of God; they’d rather heed to the promptings of gratifying sensual pleasures, than the promptings of the Holy Ghost. This is idolatry; it ought not to be so.</p>
		  	<p>Everything is summarized in this—avoid and fight that, which makes you to love or venerate anything more than God.</p>
		  	<p>God is our help in times of trouble—not our friends; He is our companion at all times—not the social media or phones; He is everything—nothing else remains after everything is chosen. Be blessed!</p>
