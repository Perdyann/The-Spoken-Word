		  	<p><i>But we all, with open face beholding as in a glass the glory of the Lord, are changed into the same image from glory to glory, even as by the Spirit of the Lord. (2 Corinthians 3:18)</i></p>

		  	<blockquote>Until the veil is torn, transformation can never occur.</blockquote>

		  	<p>The glory of the Lord cannot be seen by people, whose faces are veiled. As long as the glory of the Lord remains unseen, your life remains unchanged. In essence, a man can never be transformed until his face is unveiled.</p>
		  	<p>Over recent years, the enemy has used veils to blind the eyes of many, lest they see the glory of God (2 Corinthians 4:4). The enemy understands how important it is for a man to see God’s glory, in order for him to be transformed. That is why he goes to any length to ensure that he keeps them blind.</p>
		  	<p>Many have been blinded by the veils of false doctrines and silly myths; they would never pay attention to the truth, because they are already brain washed by some false doctrines.</p>
		  	<p>Have you ever come across people who tell you that you are too young to understand the bible? I’ve experienced such people. If I was to believe that, I wouldn’t bother reading the bible anymore. I will probably wait until my life is over.</p>
		  	<p>God told Jeremiah not to look at himself as a youth; I’ve never encountered a scripture that gave an age limit to the fulfillment of purpose.</p>
		  	<p>Some have tried to talk me out of my call and purpose because of my gender; what they fail to realize is that I am a spirit, and in the realm, where I operate from, there is no gender.</p>
		  	<p>Some people have attended services, and even before the sermon began. They critically analyzed the looks of the preacher (gender, age, statue, etc), and made a conclusion that nothing good can emanate from such sermon. Their faces were veiled even before the sermon began; their hearts were hardened even before the service commenced; how then can they be transformed?</p>
		  	<p>Sometimes, we hinder God’s blessings by our deliberate decision to pay attention to irrelevant things. Much more than I am concerned about the physical structure of the vessel God uses, I am concerned about the content of that vessel.</p>
		  	<p>Many have missed out on Divine orchestrations, because of the silly myths they clung unto. There is a difference between a religious man, and a spiritual being.</p>
		  	<p>A religious man reads the scripture with a veiled face, but a spiritual man rightly divides the Word of Truth with an unveiled face. Our generation needs more of spiritual beings than religious men.</p>
		  	<p>Many have heard the Word of God, but could not receive it in faith, because there was a veil that hindered its reception. Until the veil is torn, transformation can never occur.</p>
		  	<p>Denominational difference is another trending veil the enemy uses to blind the eyes of fellows. No matter how true your message is, some people will just not listen to it because of your denomination.</p>
		  	<p>Rip off those doctrinal veils, and embrace the truth as it is. When God looks at you, He doesn’t see your denomination, gender or age; He sees His image. Christ is coming back for the church, and not a particular denomination. Cast out the veils and be transformed. Be blessed!</p>
