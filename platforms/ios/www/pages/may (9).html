		  	<p><i>BLESSED is the man that walketh not in the counsel of the ungodly, nor standeth in the way of sinners, nor sitteth in the seat of the scornful.</i></p>
		  	<p><i>But his delight is in the law of the LORD; and in his law doth he meditate day and night.</i></p>
		  	<p><i>And he shall be like a tree planted by the rivers of water, that bringeth forth his fruit in his season; his leaf also shall not wither; and whatsoever he doeth shall prosper. (Psalms 1:1-3)</i></p>

		  	<blockquote>It is written, “Whatsoever he doeth shall prosper.” Even your mistakes will prosper. </blockquote>

		  	<p>A man, who does not walk in the counsel of the ungodly (does not hearken to ungodly advice, purposes and schemes); A man that standeth not in the way of sinners (someone who will in no way be corrupted by evil); A man that sitteth not in the seat of the scornful (does not waste time in folly with mockers).</p>
		  	<p>A man, whose delight is in the law of God, and he constantly meditates on God’s Word day and night. This man remains happy, fortunate, prosperous and enviable.</p>
		  	<p>To him, is given this beautiful assurance; he is blessed to prosper. Some people dislike the message of prosperity. Verily, it is scriptural, BUT not the primary message we should preach.</p>
		  	<p>Prosperity is secondary; I can only preach the message of prosperity when I’ve taught the messages of delighting in God’s law, dumping ungodly counsel, resisting evil, righteousness, wisdom, and The Kingdom of God. It is written;</p>
		  	<p><i>But seek ye first the kingdom of God, and his righteousness; and all these things shall be added unto you. (Matthew 6:33)</i></p>
		  	<p>Prosperity is only an addition (extra). You don’t seek prosperity, but God’s Kingdom. A man that walketh in the counsel of the Holy Spirit, and meditate on God’s Word day and night shall also be blessed with prosperity. Prosperity is not a message on its own, but God’s blessing on His own.</p>
		  	<p>Solomon never asked God for wealth, but wisdom. Prosperity was just an addition. Beloved, the emphasis is not on prosperity, but God; prosperity flows in supernaturally, when you delight in God.</p>
		  	<p>If only a man can walk in the statutes pronounced above (in vs.1 &2), He shall never run dry, he shall remain fruitful in all seasons, he shall never fade out. Most interestingly, <i> “whatsoever he doeth shall prosper.” </i></p>
		  	<p>Did you notice the use of the term ‘whatsoever’, in essence anything at all that you do, is blessed to prosper. That is, even your mistakes will prosper. Beloved, we have been blessed to prosper. There are no two ways about it, it is sure.</p>
		  	<p>Your involvement in anything (no matter what it is) is an assurance that it’s going to prosper. Any project you are involved in cannot but prosper. Only choose to walk in the counsel of the Holy Spirit, and meditate on the Word of God day and night.</p>
		  	<p>Why put all your focus and attention on prosperity? It is your normal heritage and right, which you don’t need to struggle to get. Only remain focused on God’s Kingdom, Word, and the Holy Spirit, and prosperity will be added. Be blessed!</p>
