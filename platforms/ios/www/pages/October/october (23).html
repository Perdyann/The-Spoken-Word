		  	<p><i>And Mary said, Behold the handmaid of the Lord; be it unto me according to thy word. And the angel departed from her. (Luke 1:38)</i></p>
		

		  	<blockquote>The Word of God transcends natural protocols, rules and customs.</blockquote>

		  	<p>The angel of the Lord visited Mary and informed her of the Son, which she was to bear. Despite the fact that everything seemed unusual, she chose to submit to God’s Word.</p>
		  	<p>What the Angel said to her was not humanly possible; it did not seem proper. During that era, marriage was to precede pregnancy. Considering the fact that she was betrothed to Joseph, it might have embarrassing for her to just get pregnant without adhering to natural protocols.</p>
		  	<p>There were rules, customs and traditions, which should have been followed; besides, a virgin had never been pregnant before then, so the chances of her story being believed were very slim.</p>
		  	<p>However, Mary chose not to think of all these possible hindrances; rather, she submitted diligently to the Word of God. She never insisted that everything should be done according to her will, but in accordance to God’s Word.</p>
		  	<p>Have you ever been caught up between protocols and the Word of God? I’m talking about protocols that have never been broken before; as such; you’re in a position of being the first, to have to break such protocols, knowing that it might be consequential.</p>
		  	<p>One understanding we must have is that the Word of God transcends natural protocols, rules and customs. It has the capacity to preserve you, even when the consequences of a broken protocol, comes knocking at your door.</p>
		  	<p>When Mary’s pregnancy was discovered, it might have been really consequential, but the Spirit of God visited Joseph. He didn’t leave her stranded.</p>
		  	<p>Just like Mary did, hold on to the Word of God not minding what the protocols are. Don’t insist on having things your own way; not your will, but in accordance to God’s Word.</p>
		  	<p>Come what may, Mary was willing to face any consequence; her only concern was that God’s Word should be fulfilled in her life.</p>
		  	<p>Beloved, it’s high time the focus is drifted from our will to the Word of God. No longer should our prayer be in our will. It should be in accordance to God’s Word. It doesn’t matter if God’s Word contradicts our will, just let it be.</p>
		  	<p>God has a reason for planting you in a place where protocols might need to be broken; His Word is higher than every rule, law, principle or protocol. Only yield yourself to His Word. Be blessed!</p>
