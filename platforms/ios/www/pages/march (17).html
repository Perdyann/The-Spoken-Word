		  	<p><i>I know thy works, that thou art neither cold nor hot: I would thou wert cold or hot.</i></p>
		  	<p><i>So then because thou art lukewarm, and neither cold nor hot, I will spue thee out of my mouth. (Revelation 3:15-16)</i></p>

		  	<blockquote>The most miserable people on earth are those who linger in tepidity and lukewarmness.</blockquote>

		  	<p>I have encountered different types of men, with different mentalities and mindset. The mindset of some people ushered them to soar in high places, and the mentality of the others, was their greatest limitation.</p>
		  	<p>Whilst some were known for greatness, others were tagged miserable. But one thing did I notice;</p>
		  	<p>The most miserable people on earth are those who linger in tepidity and lukewarmness. They are never willing to go deeper in anything; they would rather remain in the middle.</p>
		  	<p>These are such people who have become very comfortable and familiar with mediocrity. I have asked some of these people, “Are you born again”, and in reply they said, “I am a Christian, I go to church on Sundays, but I am not into those born-again stuffs.”</p>
		  	<p>This particularly leaves me wondering — why then do they claim to be Christians?—Calling yourself a Christian, because you get involved with some religious activities, does not qualify you to partake in God’s Divine nature. Thus, you remain subject to the elemental principles of the world.</p>
		  	<p>Being born-again is what qualifies you to be called a Son of God. In essence, you are not merely religious, but spiritual. I really don’t see the essence of your Christianity without being born-again, and growing deeper in the things of God. (John 3:3)</p>
		  	<p>Many Christians don’t even know that they should grow. It is quite sad that many Christians are comfortable living an average life. They often refer to themselves as lukewarm Christians.</p>
		  	<p>It is better off to be either hot or cold, than to be tepid.</p>
		  	<p><i>He that is not with me is against me; and he that gathereth not with me scattereth abroad. (Matthew 12:30)</i></p>
		  	<p>Verily, if you are not gathering with Christ, then you are scattering! (Luke 11:23) If you are not growing in spirit, then you are backsliding! If you are not increasing in knowledge, wisdom, and virtue, then you are decreasing!</p>
		  	<p>There are no two ways about it! You are either moving forward or backward. I used to think that a Christian can remain spiritually stagnant, when he is not growing, but by revelation, I discovered that stagnancy is not a spiritual term.</p>
		  	<p>Physically, when someone stops growing, he becomes stagnant; whereas, spiritually, if you are not growing, you begin to backslide.</p>
		  	<p>A Christian, who is knowledgeable of his identity in Christ, understands that by nature, he is above sickness, defeat and captivity. But a Christian, who is merely lukewarm, remains subject to worldly rules, principles, slavery, and infirmity... that’s why they remain miserable!</p>
		  	<p>They are neither hot, nor cold; the devil lives above them. Drop the grasshopper mentality! There’s nothing like lukewarm Christianity... your spiritual life can’t remain average; if you are not winning, then you are obviously at a loss.</p>
		  	<p>Refuse to be tepid in any aspect of your life; whatsoever is worth doing is worth doing well. Be blessed!</p>
