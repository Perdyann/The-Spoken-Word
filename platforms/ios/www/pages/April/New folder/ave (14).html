		  	<p><i>But Moses said to the Lord, “Oh, my Lord, I am not eloquent, either in the past or since you have spoken to your servant, but I am slow of speech and of tongue.”</i></p>
		  	<p><i>Then the Lord said to him, “Who has made man’s mouth? </i></p>
		  	<p><i>Who makes him mute, or deaf, or seeing, or blind? Is it not I, the Lord?</i></p>
		  	<p><i>Now therefore go, and I will be with your mouth and teach you what you shall speak.”</i></p>
		  	<p><i>But he said, “Oh, my Lord, please send someone else.”</i></p>
		  	<p><i>Then the anger of the Lord was kindled against Moses ... (Exodus 4:10-14)</i></p>


		  	<blockquote>Wholeness is the best life-insurance policy you could ever opt for. More than God wants the sick healed, he wants them whole. </blockquote>

		  	<p>Healing is a two way thing; it has to do with releasing and receiving in faith. God has released, and made available so much for us to possess, however, many are not receptive as a result of doubt.</p>
		  	<p>I always thought that everyone, who encountered God, was healed, until I studied further. Verily, Moses encountered God severally, but was still never able to speak distinctly.</p>
		  	<p>God played His role by healing Moses, but Moses did not let his faith act, by responding positively to the Word of God.</p>
		  	<p>Notice, after Moses had spelt out his predicament, and ineloquence to God, God made him to understand that He is God, and there is nothing impossible to Him, and then He released the healing saying,</p>
		  	<p><i>Now therefore go, and I will be with your mouth and teach you what you shall speak.</i></p>
		  	<p>If I were Moses, I’d just walk out with that Word, and Faith. If God, who makes man mute, deaf, seeing or blind, gives an order for you to go, and speak, then healing is certain! No need for arguments . . . But Moses was not receptive to this healing Word of God. He still insisted on his ways saying, <i> “Oh, my Lord, please send someone else.”</i></p>
		  	<p>Moses was disqualifying himself for an assignment that God had already qualified him for. It is then recorded, <i> “Then the anger of the Lord was kindled against Moses (Vs.14)” </i></p>
		  	<p>Verily, God healed Moses instantly, but doubt made him to be so unreceptive.</p>
		  	<p>All these happened before the birth and death of Jesus; even now, greater things than Moses had have already been released unto us. The blood that Jesus shed for us will never lose its power; not now; not in millenniums to come; never</p>
		  	<p>The power of His resurrection grants us life, health, prosperity, grace, and much more. All these are available already; however, like the case of Moses, we need to receive it in Faith.</p>
		  	<p>Beloved, there is no reason why we should be sick, after Christ has risen; receive your healing! There is no reason why we should be defeated after Christ is risen; we are conquerors!</p>
		  	<p>All that you ever need in life is yours already; however, you cannot access it until you receive it without doubt, but faith! Be blessed!</p>
