		  	<p><i>Now to Him who is able to do exceedingly abundantly above all that we ask or think, according to the power that works in us (Ephesians 3:20).</i></p>

		  	<blockquote>The best you could ever dream of yourself is not worth comparing with what God has in store for you.</blockquote>

		  	<p>Indeed, God is able to do exceedingly, abundantly above all that we can request or ever imagine. One beautiful evening as I was sitting outside my house, hearkening to the whispers of the gentle breeze, I looked up and envisaged a picture of what the future holds.</p>
		  	<p>I began to imagine how great and beautiful things could get; having a longing desire to be immediately transposed to what I dreamed. At that time, the situations around me were not so pleasant as to be compared with the vision I saw. However, I decided not to give up my vision, and I could hardly wait to get there.</p>
		  	<p>Great pictures, imaginations and visions became my companion. But just one day, as I continued to imagine great things as usual, it dawned on me that even in the climax of my dreams, visions and pictures, I’d never be able to imagine or fathom the perfect picture of what God has in store for me.</p>
		  	<p>The wholeness of this scripture was let loose on me that moment. Think about all the great dreams and ideas you’ve ever had. Think about where you visualize yourself in the next decade. The best you could ever dream of yourself is not worth comparing with what God has in store for you. God’s plan is exceedingly and abundantly above all we could ever fathom.</p>
		  	<p>Indeed, with God, ALL things are possible!</p>
		  	<p>The most amazing truth about this scripture emanates from the realization of the fact that even though God can do all things in you, He will only do it according to the power that works in you.</p>
		  	<p>In essence, your miracle and breakthrough is based on the measure of power that you carry in you. What is the magnitude of power working in you? If u stir up your spirit daily, praying in tongues, meditating on the Word of God, and declaring rhema, you will be so full of God’s power, thus, all things will be possible for you!</p>
		  	<p>No matter how possible a situation is; it may constantly remain impossible to you if there is little or no power working in you. Likewise, the power working in you could turn impossibilities to possibilities.</p>
		  	<p>There is power in every Child of God, but power has got different degrees, levels and extents. It is your responsibility to stay charged always. Fan into flames the gift of God in you. Grow and increase in power; verily, all things are possible! Be blessed!</p>
