		  	<p><i>Then Elisha said, Hear ye the word of the Lord; Thus saith the Lord, To morrow about this time shall a measure of fine flour be sold for a shekel, and two measures of barley for a shekel, in the gate of Samaria.</i></p>
		  	<p><i>Then a lord on whose hand the king leaned answered the man of God, and said, Behold, if the Lord would make windows in heaven, might this thing be? And he said, Behold, thou shalt see it with thine eyes, but shalt not eat thereof. (2 Kings 7:1-2)</i></p>


		  	<blockquote>Even if God has never done it for anyone else before, as long as you need it, He will break protocols to make it yours’</blockquote>

		  	<p>In a time when famine reached its peak, just in that season when women fed on their children, in an era where food was deemed the most scare commodity, God gave a Word through His Prophet, Elisha.</p>
		  	<p>Elisha was such a great Prophet of God; people had tried him and proved him, he had spoken, and it had been manifested, however, this certain word was unlike all other prophecies that he had ever uttered.</p>
		  	<p>Elisha declared by the Word of God, that food shall be in so much excess within a span of twenty-four hours, such that it will be given out almost freely. The captain thought, “That’s the most impossible thing that can ever be said at this point.”</p>
		  	<p><i>Behold, if the Lord would make windows in heaven, might this thing be?</i></p>
		  	<p>In speech, the captain expressed his doubt. His statement was very consequential, as Elisha responded, <i> “Behold, thou shalt see it with thine eyes, but shalt not eat thereof.” </i></p>
		  	<p>How then should we respond when God says the impossible?</p>
		  	<p><i>And when thou art come in, thou shalt shut the door upon thee and upon thy sons, and shalt pour out into all those vessels, and thou shalt set aside that which is full.</i></p>
		  	<p><i>So she went from him, and shut the door upon her and upon her sons, who brought the vessels to her; and she poured out.</i></p>
		  	<p><i>And it came to pass, when the vessels were full, that she said unto her son, Bring me yet a vessel. And he said unto her, There is not a vessel more. And the oil stayed. (2 Kings 4:4-6)</i></p>
		  	<p>Prior to that time, Elisha had also come to the aid of a helpless widow, who was indebted. He gave her a command that is naturally impossible. Notice her response to Elisha’s Word. Unlike the Captain did, this woman silently walked out in obedience.</p>
		  	<p>The mistake of man is limiting God. Even when God speaks, we sometimes question, ‘how?’ Beloved, God is not man. There is nothing impossible with God.</p>
		  	<p>Out of experience, we have tagged some situations possible, and others impossible (mostly because we have never seen them occur). Men rely on nature, economy, and medicine much more than they rely on the Word of God.</p>
		  	<p>Jesus defied the law of nature, by walking on water; He defied all medical laws by healing the sick and raising the dead. What Elisha said to these fellows contradicted the law of economy.</p>
		  	<p>The captain doubted because he was a carnal man, who operated by natural laws and principles. However, the Widow obeyed, because she placed all her trust in God’s word.</p>
		  	<p>Beloved, what should our response be when God says the impossible? Doubt or obedience? As a Son of God, never regard anything as impossible; the word ‘impossible’ should be banned from your vocabulary.</p>
		  	<p>Trust God in every situation, even if God has never done it for anyone else before, as long as you need it, He will break protocols to make it yours’. Be blessed!</p>
