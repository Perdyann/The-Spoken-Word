		  	<p><i>Now when he had left speaking, he said unto Simon, Launch out into the deep, and let down your nets for a draught.</i></p>
		  	<p><i>And Simon answering said unto him, Master, we have toiled all the night, and have taken nothing: nevertheless at thy word I will let down the net.</i></p>
		  	<p><i>And when they had this done, they inclosed a great multitude of fishes: and their net brake. (Luke 5:4-6)</i></p>


		  	<blockquote>The darker the night gets, the closer you are to the dawning of a brand new day. Giving up now will only make you regret not waiting an extra second. </blockquote>

		  	<p>Simon Peter had toiled all night. So often, we read over these lines, without making something out of it. That night was not like any other night to Simon Peter. The use of the term ‘toiled’, reveals the fact that they worked extremely hard to get a fish, but received nothing.</p>
		  	<p>The work that night was quite unusual; it was characterized by excessive stress, struggles and efforts, nevertheless, it yielded nothing. This particularly made the night seem so long.</p>
		  	<p>If you have had a long night before, you will understand exactly, the height of plight these fellows were subjected to. They could not rest; they could not sleep, but toiled endlessly, without results.</p>
		  	<p>When they were at the verge of giving up on that stream; when they had almost called it a day; the best was released after their stress. This goes to show that — <b> sometimes, the end is not when we think it is.</b></p>
		  	<p>When you’ve been through the stage of excessive toiling in life, and find yourself at the verge of giving up, understand that you are getting really close to your breakthrough.</p>
		  	<p>The darker the night gets, the closer you are to the dawning of a brand new day. You might be going through challenges that only get tougher by the days. You might have toiled so hard to succeed, but yielded nothing. Don’t give up; you’re closer to the breakthrough than you think.</p>
		  	<p>If anyone had told Simon that he will get such net-breaking amount of fishes before the day’s end, he would have probably spanked the person for making a joke out of his toil. But it was true. The darker the night got, the closer his breakthrough drew.</p>
		  	<p><i>Then Elisha said, Hear ye the word of the Lord; Thus saith the Lord, To morrow about this time shall a measure of fine flour be sold for a shekel, and two measures of barley for a shekel, in the gate of Samaria. (2 Kings 7:1)</i></p>
		  	<p>In a time of intense famine, when women had resorted to eating their children, God gave a Word of abundance. The amazing thing about this passage is the timing of the miracle. To morrow about this time</p>
		  	<p>I began to wonder, if the women that ate up their children had known that the breakthrough was coming in just a couple of hours, they would have found a way to endure. They just couldn’t recognize how close they were to the solution.</p>
		  	<p>Don’t give up today. the breakthrough will arrive this time tomorrow; Don’t make decisions today, that will make you wish you had waited a couple of hours; Don’t pack your bags yet, there is a better tomorrow; Don’t eat your child today, food shall be abundant tomorrow.</p>
		  	<p>Beloved, your tomorrow is much closer than you think it is; giving up now will only make you regret not waiting an extra second.</p>
		  	<p>In both passages referenced today, the people involved depended on God’s Word, even when everything seemed impossible. Simon Peter had almost given up on the water; nevertheless, at God’s Word, he let down his net again. The people of the city had given up on food, but by the Word of God, a breakthrough came sooner than expected.</p>
		  	<p>Beloved, in the height of the crises you might be going through, stick to the Word of God, and watch your breakthrough occur sooner than you think it will. You are so blessed!</p>
