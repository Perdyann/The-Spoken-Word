		  	<p><i>And as it is appointed unto men once to die, but after this the judgment: (Hebrews 9:27)</i></p>
		  

		  	<blockquote>The choices of your earthly existence influence your eternity.</blockquote>

		  	<p>Only one life, how will you live it? Before a man dies, he is referred to by his name, but after death we hear, “lower the body . . . Bury the corpse . . .” Indeed, he becomes nothing but a mere body after death.</p>
		  	<p>Everything is vanity; all material possessions, ambition, thrive, and reputation, sums up to nothing after death. Life is once; will you spend it focusing on vainglory, or will you invest in eternity.</p>
		  	<p>As the scripture rightly states, all men must die once; but remain conscious thereafter. In essence, we have just one life that never ends . . . Death does not bring life to an end, but separates a man from the earth and its treasures. Indeed, there is still judgment at the other end.</p>
		  	<p>There is only one life; how you live on the earth determines what your eternity will be like.</p>
		  	<p>Will you be sold out to God or carried away by the vain things of the earth? Will you be focused on fulfilling purpose, or will you be driven by mere ambition? Will you be humble in service or arrogant till death?</p>
		  	<p>The choice is yours’ to make, but bear in mind—there is only one life! The choices of your earthly existence influence your eternity.</p>
		  	<p>With an understanding that there is only one life, we should live the best out of it. Be loving to everyone, knowing that you might not have an opportunity to treat them as nice again.</p>
		  	<p>There is no second life, where previous mistakes can be amended. It is appointed for man to die once; there is only one life. When it is over, it is indeed over!</p>
		  	<p>The treasures you seek today will be considered vanity tomorrow; Seek treasures that outlast time; if the treasure is not eternal, then it is not worth your pursuit.</p>
		  	<p>Invest all your time and effort in things that last through eternity; there’s no time to chase after vanity. Be blessed!</p>
