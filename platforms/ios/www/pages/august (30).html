		  	<p><i>Heaven and earth shall pass away, but my words shall not pass away. (Matthew 24:35)</i></p>

		  	<blockquote>Many things have I held in my hands, and I lost them all, but there is certainly one thing that can never be lost – The Word.</blockquote>

		  	<p>There is nothing a man has today, which he is assured of having until tomorrow. Treasures come into our lives to serve a certain season, and when the season is spent, the treasure is no more. There is only but one thing that remains, even when all else is gone — The Word.</p>
		  	<p>Many things have I held in my hands, and I lost them all, but there is certainly one thing that can never be lost—The Word.</p>
		  	<p>There are times when I penned down very great revelations, and I lost them. But one thing did I realize, I might have lost the tangibility of those particular revelations, but as long as the source lives in me, I can only come up with something greater.</p>
		  	<p>Real treasures are the treasures that remain even when all else is gone; they are indestructible.</p>
		  	<p>There are so many treasures on earth, but they are all vanity! These treasures will fade away over time, and eventually vanish. There is not one earthly treasure that can be carried along after death. The only real treasure is the Word of God; that’s all that is bound to remain when all else is gone.</p>
		  	<p>As long as you have the real treasure, you have it all; your job might pass away, but as long as you have the Word, you can only get better;your valuables might get lost, but as long as you have the Word, they can be recovered. There is no situation that is beyond the power of the Word.</p>
		  	<p>The earth will melt; the things you hold today will be no more; the treasures of the present day will be nothing tomorrow; the fame of this day will be unnoticed in time to come; even pleasures will pass away; the only constant treasure is God’s Word.</p>
		  	<p>If you have not discovered the Word, then your life has not started yet. Everything a man does outside the Word of God is bound to pass away; every glory a man attains outside God’s Word is bound to fade away; every title a man gains outside God is bound to perish.</p>
		  	<p>The Word of God reveals the purpose of our life; it keeps us just in the right track; it guides us to our destiny.</p>
		  	<p>Without the Word, destiny can never be attained. Yea, no man has reached his destiny without God’s Word; those, who went through life without the Word, must have ended at the wrong destination. Be blessed!</p>
