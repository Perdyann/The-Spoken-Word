		  	<p><i>For my people have committed two evils; they have forsaken me the fountain of living waters, and hewed them out cisterns, broken cisterns, that can hold no water. (Jeremiah 2:13)</i></p>

		  	<blockquote>More than you value your pride before men... More than you desire to be in possession of all valuable treasures... Value your relationship with God</blockquote>

		  	<p>The fountain is a source of water; it gives water in and out of time; it quenches the thirst of many, but never gets thirsty or dry. So often, men run to the fountain in times of thirst, and receive water from it.</p>
		  	<p>The importance of water cannot be overemphasised. A large percentage of what we do or use in a day, involves water. Water is a commodity that man cannot do without. It is mostly held in cisterns.</p>
		  	<p>In this context, the fountain of living waters is the source of water, and the cistern is a holder of water.</p>
		  	<p>We must understand that the source is greater than the content! God is the fountain of living water . . . He is the giver of all things (wealth, blessings, favour, amongst others).</p>
		  	<p>What baffles me is how men are so desperate to receive the content, so much that they compromise their relationship with the source.</p>
		  	<p>I am embarrassed at the way men desperately seek material possessions via all wrong means, in order to achieve a temporal gain or satisfaction, such that they lose a touch of the Father who gives all things. It is written:</p>
		  	<p><i>For the Lord God is a sun and shield: the Lord will give grace and glory: no good thing will he withhold from them that walk uprightly. (Psalm 84:11)</i></p>
		  	<p>If indeed God, who is the fountain and source of everything, will not withhold anything good from me, as long as I walk uprightly before Him, how is it that I should give up my relationship with Him, in order to get temporarily, something that He could permanently give me?</p>
		  	<p>If indeed God will not withhold anything good from me, it simply means that whatever I don’t have is not good for me. Why then, as though I have no knowledge of this, seek in desperation things that are not God’s will for me?</p>
		  	<p>More than you value your pride before men... More than you desire honour from men... More than you desire to be in possession of all valuable treasures... Value your relationship with God!</p>
		  	<p>Don’t be that Minister who will compromise his spiritual stand for fame. Don’t be that man will sin against God to please man. Don’t be that man who will forsake the Word of God to impress his self-will.</p>
		  	<p>God is seeking men who will value the source more than the content. God is seeking wise men who will rather embrace the fountain of living water, than the broken cisterns . . . God is seeking men who are genuinely after his heart, and not his hands.</p>
		  	<p>There is a call for revival; many men have missed it! They get a little bit from God, and drift to men. They start up in God, and derail along the way. It is time to go back to the fountain where we first began; it is time to go back to the place where we first received Christ.</p>
		  	<p>Beloved, examine yourself today, What is your stand in God? God has more in store for us; we just need to abide in Him. Don’t try to hewn cisterns for yourself at the expense of the fountain of living waters. Be blessed!</p>
