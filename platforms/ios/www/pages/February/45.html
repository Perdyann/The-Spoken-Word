		  	<p><i>For every one that asketh receiveth; and he that seeketh findeth; and to him that knocketh it shall be opened.</i></p>
		  	<p><i>Or what man is there of you, whom if his son ask bread, will he give him a stone? Or if he ask a fish, will he give him a serpent? (Matthew 7:8)</i></p>
		  	


		  	<blockquote>Until we learn to ask in God’s will, we will never receive.</blockquote>

		  	<p>So often, I’ve read this passage, and viewed it from different perspectives. It assures us, that everyone (whosoever) that asks receives. In essence, anyone that has not received has not asked. This was not always the case for me, because in some situations, I asked, but did not receive. Hence, I was left wondering—to what effect is this scripture addressed?—Only then did I grasp what was meant. Indeed, receiving is not only brought about by asking, but by asking rightly.</p>
		  	<p>This scripture gave light to that truth when it was further quoted, “Or what man is there of you, whom if his son ask bread, will he give him a stone?” Indeed, God will not give us stones when we ask for bread; neither will He give us serpent when we’ve asked for fish. On the other hand, what happens when we ask for serpent or stones? Do you really expect our Father to grant a request that isn’t good enough for us? It’s not just about asking, but asking rightly.</p>
		  	<p>Jeremiah 29:11 makes us to understand that God has great plans for our lives. Sometimes, due to our ignorance about the plan of God for our lives, we ask for things that seem right to us, which are contrary to God’s plan. We really don’t know what we need, as much as God does. It is important, not just to ask, but to ask in the will of God. Until we learn to ask in God’s will, we will never receive.</p>
		  	<p>I was in such a situation, where I asked for something which I thought was good enough for me . . . However, this was contrary to God’s will. I didn’t receive it, and as I went back to my private place of meditation and prayer, I was not happy because I did not get what I desired. Here’s what God showed me immediately:</p>
		  	<p><i>Ye ask, and receive not, because ye ask amiss, that ye may consume it upon your lusts. (James 4:3)</i></p>
		  	<p>It just dawned on me that I had asked amiss. Indeed, so often, we ask and do not receive, not because God does not keep to His Words, but because we have asked amiss. God is not willing to give us the stone and serpent we have asked for, when He knows that bread and fish is what we need.</p>
		  	<p>It pays to ask rightly. Ask anything in the will of God, and you shall receive, but never ask amiss. If indeed, as the scripture has said, <i><b> For every one that asketh receiveth, </b></i> then we can conclude that those who have not received, have either not asked, or have asked amiss.</p>
		  	<p>Our life was bought with a price! We are no longer the ones that live, but Christ who lives in us. We are sold out to Christ. Therefore, we ought not to act by our own will, but by the leading of the Holy Spirit. Be blessed!</p>
