		  	<p><i>For as many as are led by the Spirit of God, they are the sons of God.</i></p>
		  	<p><i>And if children, then heirs; heirs of God, and joint-heirs with Christ; if so be that we suffer with him, that we may be also glorified together. (Romans 8:14 &17)</i></p>

		  	<blockquote>The Christian life as a babe is slavery; only sons are truly heirs.</blockquote>

		  	<p>Beloved, do you know that by virtue of our new-birth, we have been adopted as children of God? We are not mere servants of God, but children—Joint heirs with Christ.</p>
		  	<p>The moment you got saved, something supernatural happened! You were translated from the earthly realm to God’s realm of life. From Romans 10:10, we understand that salvation is brought about by believing and confessing Jesus as Lord.</p>
		  	<p>Sometime ago, I had a conversation with an Uncle of mine; he admitted that he believes in God, and on many occasions, he had responded to altar calls, where he boldly confessed Jesus as Lord of his life. However, for some reason, he argued that nothing has changed since then.</p>
		  	<p>Quite a lot of people have similar cases, but one thing I can boldly say in all certainty, about these fellows, is that they stopped at the salvation line. They never bothered to go further.</p>
		  	<p>Although the born-again man is a joint-heir with Christ, this cannot be a reality until we grow into sonship. We are born children of God, but there is a difference between a child and a son.</p>
		  	<p>It is written, <i> “Unto us a child is born, unto us a son is given” (Isaiah 9:6).</i></p>
		  	<p>Children are born, but sons are given. At the time of your new-birth (salvation), you were only but a child; Sonship is a greater degree of power and authority, only obtained by your level of maturity. It is written,</p>
		  	<p><i>Now I say, That the heir, as long as he is a child, differeth nothing from a servant, though he be lord of all; (Galatians 4:1)</i></p>
		  	<p>By virtue of our birth, we are heirs, but in reality a child is not grown enough to inherit anything, so he is not different from the servants. Until he grows to a Son, he is not really the heir.</p>
		  	<p>Likewise, someone who receives Christ, and stops at the salvation line, is just a new-born. Such a person is an heir by virtue of his birth, but because of his level of immaturity, he is not yet different from the servants. He needs to grow first.</p>
		  	<p>Now I understand why my uncle didn’t feel so different from others even after he had been born-again. He was still a babe, who is actually not different from the servants.</p>
		  	<p>The Christian life as a babe is slavery; only sons are truly heirs. Don’t be satisfied with salvation; grow in the full knowledge of our Lord.</p>
		  	<p>It is written: <i>For the earnest expectation of the creature waiteth for the manifestation of the sons of God. (Romans 8:19)</i></p>
		  	<p>The world is not waiting for the manifestation of babes, or just anyone, but of Sons. Don’t stop at salvation, grow into a Son.</p>
		  	<p>Infants can do nothing on their own, they depend on servants and tutors, but sons are in charge of everything. After salvation, what next? Sonship! Be blessed!</p>
