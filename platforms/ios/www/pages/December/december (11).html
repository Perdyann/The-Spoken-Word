		  <div class="panel-body" style="text-align:justify">


		  	<p><i>For as the rain cometh down, and the snow from heaven, and returneth not thither, but watereth the earth, and maketh it bring forth and bud, that it may give seed to the sower, and bread to the eater:</i></p>
		  	<p><i>So shall my word be that goeth forth out of my mouth: it shall not return unto me void, but it shall accomplish that which I please, and it shall prosper in the thing whereto I sent it. (Isaiah 55:10-11)</i></p>
		  

		  	<blockquote>When you digest as much of God’s Word as possible in your Spirit, no mountain remains tall before you.</blockquote>

		  	<p>The Word of God is likened to the rain and snow; when the rain comes down, it transforms a dry land, it causes the plants to flourish and it makes the land productive.</p>
		  	<p>A land that was previously barren could be made fruitful by reason of the showers of the rain. A land that was previously hard and too rocky to be cultivated, can be softened by the rain.</p>
		  	<p>Beloved, the Word of God is just like the rain to a land. Just as the hard soil is softened by a few drops of the rain, so is a hard-heartened man arrested by the Word of God.</p>
		  	<p>Saul was too hard-heartened; he took advantage of the slightest opportunity to persecute the Church, but when his heart came in contact with God’s Word, a great transformation occurred. There is no heart too hard for the Word of God to penetrate.</p>
		  	<p>Secondly, the rain causes the plants to flourish; in the same way, the Word of God causes a man to flourish, prosper, excel and be outstanding. Daniel, Shedrach, Meshach and Abednego chose to feed on the Word of God, rather than defile themselves with the fats of the kings table.</p>
		  	<p>When that period was over, they flourished so much more than the men, who fed on the kings’ meat and wine. They looked healthier than everyone else. The Word of God is enough to make a man flourish, excel and prosper.</p>
		  	<p>Furthermore, rain causes the land to be productive; likewise, the Word of God is productive. I am yet to encounter a situation that came in contact with God’s Word, and failed to yield a miraculous result.</p>
		  	<p>Pastor Chris Oyakhilome said, “one thing is certain, if you stick to the Word, you’d come back with a testimony.” Verily, the Word of God is what produces testimonies.</p>
		  	<p>In Psalm 138:2, it is declared that the Lord has exalted His Word above all His names. Beloved, there is obviously something about the Word of God.</p>
		  	<p>Previously, we studied how great a mantle of Authority, the name of God is. It is amazing to fathom that as great as His Name is, His Word is exalted above it. The name of God is our mantle of Authority in the same way His Word is our instrument of Authority.</p>
		  	<p>There is something about the Word of God that quickens the spirit. His Word brings about transformation, prosperity and productiveness. How can you be barren when you’ve got the Word? How can you lag behind when you feed on the Word?</p>
		  	<p>When you digest as much of God’s Word as possible in your Spirit, no mountain remains tall before you. Be blessed!</p>
