		  	<p><i>Rejoice, and be exceeding glad: for great is your reward in heaven: for so persecuted they the prophets which were before you. (Matthew 5:12)</i></p>

		  	<blockquote>Because of the revelations Joseph had, he was sold; because of the revelations Stephen had, he was stoned; revelation attracts challenges.</blockquote>

		  	<p>Prophets are known for the extent of revelations they receive; what distinct them from others is their ability to see and fathom what others cannot, their ability to know and comprehend mysteries, and the uncommon revelations they have.</p>
		  	<p>For the revelations of the Prophets, they were reviled and persecuted; because of the revelations Joseph had, he was sold; because of the revelations Stephen had, he was stoned; revelation attracts challenges.</p>
		  	<p>If the Prophets, Joseph and Stephen were not men of revelation, they wouldn’t be reviled, persecuted or challenged. Revelation will launch you through diverse phases of plights, but rejoice! There is a reward.</p>
		  	<p>You cannot expect to receive a revelation without a test, trial and persecution. For every Word breathed by God, there must be a test.</p>
		  	<p>When Jesus called Peter to walk on the water with Him, Peter received that Word and began to walk on the water. What he did not know was that there was a trial for that Word.</p>
		  	<p>Revelations will always be tested before they can be proved. You cannot preach a Word, which you have not tried. Remember what Jesus said,</p>
		  	<p><i>If the world hate you, ye know that it hated me before it hated you. (John 15:18)</i></p>
		  	<p>Before He could teach us how to react to the hatred of the world, He had to have been hated by it.</p>
		  	<p>Revelations will take you through different phases of plights, afflictions, persecutions and trials, just for you to be able to lead those after you. If you’ve not been through the challenges yourself, you can never motivate anyone to overcome it.</p>
		  	<p>As much as we celebrate the revelations we receive and share, we should get ready for the test that comes with it.</p>
		  	<p>Revelations attract oppositions, but it has the capacity to preserve. Despite the opposition the Prophets and Joseph faced, they were not consumed, but preserved.</p>
		  	<p>Despite the pain, opposition and betrayal they faced, they fulfilled their destiny. They were not destroyed by the plights, but preserved for the promise. The revelation might have a painful test, but even more, it has a preserved promise. Be blessed!</p>
