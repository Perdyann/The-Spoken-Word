		  	<p><i>Thy word is a lamp unto my feet, and a light unto my path.(Psalms 119:105)</i></p>
		

		  	<blockquote>A life void of the Word of God is a disaster yet to occur.</blockquote>

		  	<p>One of the craziest things to do is to drive a car late at night without the headlights on. By so doing, you have deliberately signed your own death warrant.</p>
		  	<p>The purpose of the head-lights positioned in front of any vehicle, is to give light and direction to our paths. That’s just how the Word of God is to man; as we tread the journey of life, we must be sure to have our head-lights turned on at all times.</p>
		  	<p>If at any point, you turn off the lamp, and decide to direct yourself to your destiny, you will get caught up in the ditch that has no way out.</p>
		  	<p>The Word of God is the lamp, and head-light we require at all times, to give us direction to our destiny in life. A life void of the Word of God is a disaster yet to occur.</p>
		  	<p>At some point, I’ve been directed by my senses, and at some other point, I received direction from the scripture breathed by God; the results of my course both times varied. Now I can confidently say that it pays to be directed by the Word of God.</p>
		  	<p>The psalmist rightly likens the Word of God to a lamp. When do we use lamps? When you find yourself walking in the dark and lacking the ability to see and understand your route clearly, the best thing you could have is a lamp, to give light and direct your paths.</p>
		  	<p>That’s just how the Word of God is to us; we know in part, and we understand in part; the height of our human knowledge is considered folly by God; if decisions were ours to make, we will all end up in the pit of folly.</p>
		  	<p>There are times in life, when we are confronted with situations that require an urgent decision on the direction of approach. At such points, when mistakes cannot be tolerated, and we can’t afford to miss out, how do we receive direction? The lamp!</p>
		  	<p>Beloved, if there’s one advice I can give to any driver; it is, keep your head-lights on. Never turn off the lamp!</p>
		  	<p>The solution to every problem in life; the answer to every question in life; the result of every test in life; are all located in the Word of God. There is no problem you can ever face that lacks a Word solution.</p>
		  	<p>The best thing that can happen to any man is to have his life directed by God’s Word every second; that life is sure to ascend and soar on heights that men have never comprehended.</p>
		  	<p>Rather than worrying over your situation, find out what the Word of God says about it; has the Doctor given you a report? Drop it for a moment, and read the Lords report.</p>
		  	<p>Don’t let your life be defined by the situations around you, get your life’s definition from God’s Word. Always remember; you are not who the world defines you as, but who the Word says you are. Be blessed!</p>
