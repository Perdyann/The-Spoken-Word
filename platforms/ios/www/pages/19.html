		  	<p><i>And it occurred that when Elizabeth heard Mary’s greeting, the baby leaped in her womb, and Elizabeth was filled with and controlled by the Holy Spirit. (Luke 1:41)</i></p>

		  	<blockquote>You don’t need to struggle and hustle to reflect greatness. It’s inborn, it makes room for itself when you discover and build it.</blockquote>

		  	<p>Elizabeth carried a unique deposit; she harbored prophecy in her womb. This was a very sensitive stage of her life. I love what ensued as a result of her encounter with Mary. Elizabeth said to Mary, <i> “The moment I heard your salutation, the baby in my womb leaped for joy” </i> Be careful who you open your doors to. Some people’s mandate in your life is to terminate your seed. Open your doors only to those that make your baby leap!</p>
		  	<p>We are seeds of Abraham (greatness); therefore, there is a deposit of greatness in you. Every man born of God has greatness in-built on the inside of him. There are different aspects of greatness, and all we need to do is to discover our potentials, and maximize them.</p>
		  	<p>If you really know and understand who you are in God, you wouldn’t need to struggle and hustle to reflect greatness. It’s inborn, it makes room for itself when you discover and build it.</p>
		  	<p>When God gives you a vision, do you really incubate on it? Do you really build it? When the master of a house distributed talents, some developed it, and others buried it. You might be struggling tirelessly to be achieved simply because you’ve not aligned your talents to purpose.</p>
		  	<p>It matters so much the company you let around you when you harbor a vision or a promise. When you’ve got a vision, be careful to open your doors only to those that will make your baby leap for joy. Some people come into your life for no other reason than to destroy your vision. Be discerning enough to define your company at this sensitive period.</p>
		  	<p>Beloved, we are carriers of a unique deposit. I always say to People, “there is something you have, which no one else has. There is something you carry, which the enemy is envious of.” He couldn’t stop God from depositing greatness in you, but he constantly strives to terminate that seed of greatness in you.</p>
		  	<p>Like never before, it is time to be sensitive. Your sensitivity should encompass your company, and information. Men of vision should mingle with visionaries. At such a sensitive stage of life, it matters a lot who you open your doors to. Be careful how you let people into your life.</p>
		  	<p>The outer-court is meant for anyone. The sitting room is meant for special guests, but the bed-room (inner-circle) is strictly for family. Likewise, who, and what you let in to the inner-circle of your life matters a lot. Not everyone means well.  Open your doors only to people who impart your vision, and seed with good tidings; bearing in mind that you are a carrier of something very unique. Be blessed!</p>
