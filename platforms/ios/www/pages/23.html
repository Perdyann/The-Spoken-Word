		  	<p><i>David was greatly distressed, for the men spoke of stoning him because the souls of them all were bitterly grieved, each man for his sons and daughters. But David encouraged and strengthened himself in the Lord his God. (1 Samuel 30:6)</i></p>


		  	<blockquote>Rise up from the place of the mourners... Go and hear from the Master!</blockquote>

		  	<p>This was such a time when the enemy struck the Israelites unawares; a season when they were attacked unknowingly... While they were on assignment, the enemy invaded, and stole all they had, leaving them with nothing but a burnt and empty land to behold. They wept! But weeping was not enough to restore what was lost... the greater burden rested on David, for he was the King of them all.</p>
		  	<p>Men thought of stoning him... the entire blame was rested on him... The pressure was too much for him alone to bear... He had no answer or words of consolation to give, for he was also afflicted.</p>
		  	<p>At such a time as this, I am pretty sure that many will question the existence of God. But David encouraged and strengthened himself in the Lord.</p>
		  	<p>If there’s one thing I’d say today, discover your source of strength. David knew that at such a time, the right place to be was in the arms of the Father. His kingdom was against him.</p>
		  	<p>One thing is sure, when all else is gone, God remains. He is our hope, strength, comfort and confidant. Whatever you might be going through in life, always bear in mind, there’s no better place to be, than in the arms of God. It is the place where revelations and answers are given.</p>
		  	<p>Notice: as long as David remained with his people, he was depressed, afflicted, and sorrowful. From the moment he found solace in the arms of God, his comfort and strength was restored.</p>
		  	<p>God had an instruction for him, but he couldn’t receive it in the place of depression. He had to move to his personal altar with the Father, in order for him to find comfort, strength and solution. It was not until he did this that he heard the Lord say, <i> “Pursue, for you shall surely overtake them and without fail recover all.” (1 Samuel 30:8)</i></p>
		  	<p>Rise up from the place of the mourners . . . Go and hear from the Master! As long as you keep lamenting on that ground of depression, you can never move forward. You’ve got to move privately to the solace of the Father to recover strength, and receive the solution.</p>
		  	<p>Today, I admonish you to do away with all the heart-aches and breaks of the past. Rise up from the place of the comforters... Seek counsel in the arms of God alone, for He is the answer to all hidden mysteries.</p>
