		  <div class="panel-body" style="text-align:justify">


		  	<p><i>You shall no more be termed Forsaken, and your land shall no more be termed Desolate, but you shall be called My Delight Is in Her, and your land Married; for the LORD delights in you, and your land shall be married. (Isaiah 62:4 ESV)</i></p>
		  


		  	<blockquote>Thinking of you, His heart is gladdened; looking at you, he wears a smile. You are the best of God’s creation. </blockquote>

		  	<p>Have you ever delighted in someone or something? A mere thought of it gladdens your heart, and dresses your face with a warm smile. That’s just the way the Lord delights in you, and continually has you in his Hand.</p>
		  	<p>There are situations we may have gone that made us really feel forsaken; at such seasons, people asked, “where is your God?” Beloved, the season for entertaining such wrong thoughts that you’ve been forsaken is over!</p>
		  	<p>We are inscribed on the palm of God, our walls are continually before Him; His eyes are fixed on you constantly, and He never gets tired of seeing you. His heart is gladdened, and He is delighted in you.</p>
		  	<p>Reading a bit further, it is said that as the bridegroom rejoices over the bride, so does God rejoice over us.</p>
		  	<p>Verily, if only you had an idea how the Lord delights and rejoices over you, you will not harbor any contradicting thought. Thinking of you, His heart is gladdened; looking at you, he wears a smile.</p>
		  	<p>Much more than our affairs matter to us, it matters to God. If God provides for the birds of the air that doesn’t work; if He glamorously clothes the lilies and constantly watches over the sparrow; how much more you? It is written:</p>
		  	<p><i>There is a river whose streams make glad the city of God, the holy place where the Most High dwells. (Psalms 46:4 NIV)</i></p>
		  	<p>Beloved, you are that river. Streams of living waters gush out from your belly; and those streams gladden the heart of God. You are the best of God’s creation.</p>
		  	<p>The Lord is proud of you. He never created any other thing to rule dominate and take charge, but man; He never made any other creature in his image and likeness, but man. For the mistake of man, God sacrificed His only son.</p>
		  	<p>Verily, God has given us so much to live above everything; the only reason why you might not be living that great life, is because you have not yet stretched your hands to receive what God holds for you.</p>
		  	<p>The fact that there are so many men with un-kept hairs on the street doesn’t mean that there is no barber on that same street; it simply means that they have not bothered to go for a shave.</p>
		  	<p>Beloved, God loves you much more than you can imagine; He spared you from tragedy so many times; He constantly delights in you; only take refuge in His arms today.</p>
		  	<p>Receive Him, and let him make life worth living; Be blessed!</p>
