		  	<p><i>But the day of the Lord will come as a thief in the night; in which the heavens shall pass away with a great noise, and the elements shall melt with fervent heat, the earth also and the works that are therein shall be burned up.</i></p>
		  	<p><i>Seeing then that all these things shall be dissolved, what manner of persons ought ye to be in all holy conversation and godliness, (2 Peter 3:10-11)</i></p>

		  	<blockquote>We are on earth to run a race . . . it is not the comfort and pleasure of the race that determines our medal, but how well we ran the race, even till the final destination.</blockquote>

		  	<p>So much goes through the mind of any individual reading this scripture; when is the day of the Lord? Verily, this is no other day than that period, when a man has lived up his time</p>
		  	<p>I have discovered that no matter how many years God assigns to a man to live—100, 150 or even a thousand, he will surely live it up. Where are the Methuselah’s of long ago? Where are the Pharaohs of old? What matters most is not how long a man lives but how well he lives.</p>
		  	<p>Death is a thief that steals without permission. It comes to steal away life. I am yet to see a man, whom death sought his permission before his life was given up. The world has encountered all ranks of great men, celebrities, and stars. There are people who we never imagined will die, but they all did, when the number of their days were exhausted.</p>
		  	<p>Someone said, the richest place is the grave—Many unaccomplished dreams, visions and missions are buried right there — </p>
		  	<p>Beloved, this passage clearly portrays the fact that after death, all the achievements, fame, possessions, materials and titles, which a man may have labored to earn, will melt away and be dissolved. Peter then goes on to admonish everyone saying, <i> “Seeing then that all these things shall be dissolved, what manner of persons ought ye to be in all holy conversation and godliness” </i> </p>
		  	<p>Having known all these, what manner of person ought we to be? Is it still important that we set our utmost cares on the things beneath? Is it still important that we compromise our spiritual stand to attain temporal earthly satisfaction? The bible says,</p>
		  	<p><i>“For what shall it profit a man, if he shall gain the whole world, and lose his own soul?” (Mark 8:36)</i></p>
		  	<p>It’s embarrassing the kind of things people compromise for. Why should perishable titles, achievements, and materials make you compromise? A lot of Men of God in this age will not like to address this issue, for the fear of their own congregation. But what they fail to understand is that it is the foundation of everything. Any foundation other than the salvation of mankind is sinking sand.</p>
		  	<p>We are on earth to run a race! It is not the comfort and pleasure of the race that determines our medal, but how well we run the race, even till the final destination. People cheat, lie, and kill just to get temporal material possessions; people give up their bodies for movie roles, fake documents and results; the question remains, what becomes of eternity?</p>
		  	<p>Today, carry out a check on your own life. What is your mind focused on? What’s your main goal and drive? Is your mind set on the things beneath, which will eventually be dissolved, or are you focused on a kingdom goal?</p>
		  	<p>No man knows the day, and time his race will end. In most cases, it ends unexpectedly. Don’t be caught unawares . . . Be blessed!</p>
