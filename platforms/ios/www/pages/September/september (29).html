		  	<p><i>Wherefore seeing we also are compassed about with so great a cloud of witnesses, let us lay aside every weight, and the sin which doth so easily beset us, and let us run with patience the race that is set before us, (Hebrews 12:1).</i></p>
		 
		  	<blockquote>Anything that will get you off track is not worth your tolerance.</blockquote>

		  	<p>Athletes focus on two things when they are in a contest; speed and accuracy; these two are interdependent. Speed entails finishing the race swiftly, and in good time, whereas, accuracy entails observing all necessary protocols, and running in accordance to the rules of the game.</p>
		  	<p>I used to think that winning a race was all about being the fastest, until I realized that sometimes the first to finish gets disqualified by the protocols and rules he must have breached.</p>
		  	<p>Then, I began to think that accuracy was the key, since it entails observing necessary protocols. However, that is still not a guarantee that you will win the race; in the sense that, you can observe all rules, but not finish in good time.</p>
		  	<p>There’s got to be a blend of both speed and accuracy, to achieve any target or goal. Life is a race; the passage highlights accuracy and speed.</p>
		  	<p>It states that we should ensure that we run the race without any weight or burden whatsoever—That’s a rule, which we should accurately adhere to.</p>
		  	<p>Again it is said that we should get rid of anything that will beset or slow us down. It is obvious that someone with so much weight and burden cannot run at the same speed with a free man.</p>
		  	<p>One of the things weight does to a man is to rip him off the ability to run with speed and accuracy. A man with so much weight will easily derail, and run at a slow pace.</p>
		  	<p>Beloved, unforgiveness is a weight, and so is malice; anxiety is a weight and so is hatred. These very things keep us from running fast and well.</p>
		  	<p>I’ve noticed that people, who are fond of bearing grudges, achieve in years things that should have been achieved in a day—lack of speed!</p>
		  	<p>I’ve also notice that people, who are filled with anxiety and worry, derail so easily—lack of accuracy!</p>
		  	<p>Why then should we allow ourselves to be weighed down, seeing that it delays and hinders our progress? To win the race, you need to run on the right track, and finish at the right time; anything that will get you off track is not worth your tolerance.</p>
		  	<p>I admonish you today to cast off every burden and weight, and run in all accuracy and speed, the race that is set before you. Be blessed!</p>
