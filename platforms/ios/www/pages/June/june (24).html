		  	<p><i>Is not this the word that we did tell thee in Egypt, saying, Let us alone, that we may serve the Egyptians? For it had been better for us to serve the Egyptians, than that we should die in the wilderness. (Exodus 14:12)</i></p>
		  

		  	<blockquote>There is a specific purpose and time for the revelation of every detail. There are details you just can’t handle rightly, when they are given prematurely.</blockquote>

		  	<p>There are Words God will give you concerning your destiny; there are promises He will make in your life; but there are some details He will just not give till the appointed time.</p>
		  	<p>God does not always give details; In Isaiah 46:10, it is said; <i> Declaring the end from the beginning, and from ancient times the things that are not yet done, saying, My counsel shall stand, and I will do all my pleasure: </i></p>
		  	<p>Verily, God declares the end from the beginning, but He does not always give the details of everything that happens between the beginning and the end, and this happens for a purpose.</p>
		  	<p>As much as the Israelites doubted every possibility, they probably felt relieved to know that they could be free from the grip of the Egyptians. They were glad when they stepped out of the borders of Egypt, but again complained when they saw the Egyptians chasing after them.</p>
		  	<p>God had declared that He will not only redeem them from captivity, but give them a promise land; but He did not give them details about the trials they will have to face in the wilderness.</p>
		  	<p>Same was the case of Esther; she had been divinely favored and promoted, but the details about the trials she would have to face in her new position were yet for an appointed time.</p>
		  	<p>Initially, she never knew that there will come a time, when she will have to set aside the kings order and put her life at risk, to help the Jews; it was not until the appointed time, when Mordecai said, <i> “ ... and who knoweth whether thou art come to the kingdom for such a time as this?” (Esther 4:14) </i> that it all dawned on her.</p>
		  	<p>Joseph always knew that he was called for greatness; from the time he was in his Father’s house, he knew his destination was the palace. God showed him his destiny, but did not give some details about the journey there.</p>
		  	<p>The details of him having to go through the pit, being sold and betrayed by his brothers, being tempted and accused by Potiphar’s wife, and having to be imprisoned, was saved for the appointed time.</p>
		  	<p>God promised to make Abraham great, and to make a nation out of him; however, the details of how he will be tried, and asked to sacrifice his son, was saved for an appointed time.</p>
		  	<p>And I thought for a moment, “Why didn’t God give them the entire details from the beginning?”</p>
		  	<p>Verily, there are thing God will not give you now, because you don’t have the capacity to handle it yet. There is a specific purpose and time for the revelation of every detail.</p>
		  	<p>At the level the Israelites were, in terms of mentality, if God had pre-informed them that there will come a time when they will lack food or water in the desert, and He will provide divinely, they might have doubted, and for that reason, refused to leave Egypt.</p>
		  	<p>Again if God had informed them that their journey out of Egypt will involve being caught up between the angry Egyptians and the red sea, they will not dare step out. This is very obvious by their statement, <i> “For it had been better for us to serve the Egyptians,” </i> whereas, God had better plans for them.</p>
		  	<p>Likewise, if God had pre-informed Esther, that the position she was being prepared for, involved risking her life, she might have avoided that position. There are details you just can’t handle rightly, when they are given prematurely.</p>
		  	<p>There are details God will give in the beginning, and there some things He will hold back for the appointed time.</p>
		  	<p>In everything, as long as you know your destination, and you are well prepared, you will be able to rightly handle every new detail that emerges, and fulfill your Divine purpose. Be blessed!</p>
