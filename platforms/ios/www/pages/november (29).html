		  	<p><i>And Jesus answering said, Were there not ten cleansed? but where are the nine?</i></p>
		  	<p><i>There are not found that returned to give glory to God, save this stranger.</i></p>
		  	<p><i>And he said unto him, Arise, go thy way: thy faith hath made thee whole. (Luke 17:17-19)</i></p>
		  	

		  	<blockquote>People, who have got all they want from you, will hardly return to you. </blockquote>

		  	<p>Ten lepers were cleansed, but only one returned to give thanks.</p>
		  	<p>Sometimes it is crazy how we make prayers, supplications and pleas for the things we need, but when we receive them, we act as though we never needed them.</p>
		  	<p>As at the time when Jesus cleansed those fellows, lepers were usually isolated and harbored separately from every other individual; they never had that opportunity to mingle with other fellows, because they were considered unclean.</p>
		  	<p>Based on the situation then, I can understand how much they must have desired to get healed; I understand that they would have gone any length to fetch their healing.</p>
		  	<p>It is funny to comprehend that people, who were in such a dire need of miracle will totally change their attitude when they’ve got all they ever desired. Sometimes, when we are in need of something, and consider God as our last hope, everything changes about us. We pray more often, we are humble and as good as we possibly can; but the situation often changes when it seems like we have got what we wanted.</p>
		  	<p>This portrays one truth: people always hang around you more, when they still need something from you; but when they feel that they have got it all, and need you no more, they will be in a haste to get over you. People, who have got all they want from you, will hardly return to you. Little wonder the scripture states,</p>
		  	<p><i>“When thou hast eaten and art full, then thou shalt bless the Lord thy God for the good land which he hath given thee.” (Deuteronomy 8:10)</i></p>
		  	<p>We are admonished by this scripture not just to bless God in times of hunger, but to remain thankful, even after we are satisfied.</p>
		  	<p>I believe fifty percent of people bless their meals before eating, but less than ten percent remember to give thanks when they are done and are satisfied.</p>
		  	<p>Beloved, here’s the point, you can never get enough of God. It might seem like you have gotten all you needed, and then you drift away; I can assure you one thing, you’d come running back.</p>
		  	<p>The nine lepers felt they had it all when they were cleansed, and so they easily walked away without returning. However, one walked back in thanksgiving! Notice, this fellow was made whole.</p>
		  	<p>The other lepers received healing, but not wholeness. The joy of healing could last for a moment, till other troubles of life come knocking; but a man, who is made whole in Christ, has nothing to worry about for his entire life.</p>
		  	<p>Don’t derail, because you received healing alone, come back with a thankful heart and receive wholeness. It might seem like you’ve got it all, but there’s an addition specifically reserved for thankful people.</p>
		  	<p>Even when it seems like you’ve got it all, rather than being carried away, return in thanksgiving. Be blessed!</p>
