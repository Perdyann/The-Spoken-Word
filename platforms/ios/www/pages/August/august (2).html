		  	<p><i>And daily in the temple, and in every house, they ceased not to teach and preach Jesus Christ. (Acts 5:42)</i></p>
		  

		  	<blockquote>Be challenged by persecutions, and not impaired by them.</blockquote>

		  	<p>It is amazing to comprehend that just immediately after the Apostles had been battered, bruised and sternly warned not to preach the Gospel, they went out joyous, and spread the message all the more. The shame they went through was not enough to hinder the move of God.</p>
		  	<p>By the actions of the elders against the Apostles, they were probably convinced that they had put a stop to the message of the gospel, what they did not know is that their actions only challenged the Apostles to do more.</p>
		  	<p>The Apostles were sold out to the work of God; persecution was not enough to make them quit, but was more like petrol released on their fire.</p>
		  	<p>Many of us have been through phases less shameful than what the Apostles went through, yet for a little shame, and a little persecution, we give up our vision and retire.</p>
		  	<p>Great men are those who are unwilling to quit for the shame, but are challenged for the name. For the name of Jesus Christ, the Apostles were put to shame, but the more they were oppressed, the more they were challenged.</p>
		  	<p>Persecutions don’t make me quit; they challenge me!Jesus Christ endured the cross, despising the shame, for the sake of the glory that was laid ahead of Him; He is given a name that is above every name. How much shame are you willing to bear for that name?</p>
		  	<p>Do not quit the journey because of the roughness of the roads; don’t give up the name for the shame; don’t forsake the promises for the problems and pain. There is glory laid out at the final destination.</p>
		  	<p>The shame should not be enough to make you quit; but enough to challenge you. Be challenged by persecutions, and not impaired by them.</p>
		  	<p>Although persecuted, the Apostles ceased not to preach the gospel. Although they were put to shame, they spread the name through the ends of the earth. Don’t quit; be challenged!</p>
		  	<p>Beloved, every idea, vision, dream and plan must be tried; what qualifies it to be made great is its ability to stand firm against all odds. When the shame comes, let the vision not die.</p>
		  	<p>If Joseph had given up his dreams because of little hitches he faced, from his brothers, Potiphar, and in the cell, he wouldn’t have known fulfillment. What qualified him to attain greatness was the unwillingness to quit despite the shame.</p>
		  	<p>Many dreams have been concealed by shame, and ideas concealed by persecution. Let your vision outlive the obstacles. Don’t quit, be challenged!</p>
