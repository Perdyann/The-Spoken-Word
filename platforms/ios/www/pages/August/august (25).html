		  	<p><i>Saying, Father, if thou be willing, remove this cup from me: nevertheless not my will, but thine, be done. (Luke 22:42)</i></p>


		  	<blockquote>Until you align your will to that of the creator, you  will never reach your destiny in life.</blockquote>

		  	<p>One of the toughest prayers to make is, “thy will be done”, sometimes, even before we acknowledge God, we have desires; even before we seek God’s plan, we have already laid out plans in our minds.</p>
		  	<p>Therefore, most times, we are not really seeking the will of God, but asking God to approve our will. How long shall we continue to insist on our own ways?</p>
		  	<p>We know that God has the best plan for us, to give us a future and hope, yet sometimes, we tend to develop a hardened heart, that refuses to consent to God’s plan.</p>
		  	<p>Sometimes, we are posed with mountains so tall to climb; because of the height of the mountain, we begin to make alternative plans that are contrary to God’s will. But do we ever sit to understand God’s reason for wanting us to pass through that mountain? What we need is not to flee from the mountains, but to receive strength and grace to go through it.</p>
		  	<p>Jesus Christ was about to be given up to death; at that point, the burden of the tribulation He was to face was rested heavily upon Him; He had no one to share his pains with; He prayed until His sweat became like drops of blood.</p>
		  	<p>However, it is important to understand that even at that point, He prioritized the will of the Father. As much as he wanted the cup to pass him by, He was willing to drink of it, if that was God’s will for him.</p>
		  	<p>It is obvious that what we want is not as important as what God wants for us.</p>
		  	<p>Some years ago, I desired admission into an academic institution; I was quite desperate to get it. At that time, the worst question anyone could ask me was, “what if it’s not the will of God for you?” No! I did not want to hear that.</p>
		  	<p>I did not want to consider what God’s will was for me; all I wanted from God was for Him to grant my will. Isn’t it crazy how we sometimes insist on our ways over God’s plan?</p>
		  	<p>We keep praying for journey mercies on a trip, which we are sure God wants us to embark on. We keep praying for increased finances in a job, which God is not happy with. When will we spare a moment to find out what God’s plan is for our life?</p>
		  	<p>Virtually every day, we recite the Lord’s Prayer, quoting the line, “thy will be done on earth as it is in heaven.” So often, our lips declare those words, but our minds are far from it.</p>
		  	<p>Until a man quits insisting on his own ways, and gives in to the will of the Father, he will never soar high. The will of God might seem too cumbersome to walk in, but it can never get you stranded.</p>
		  	<p>You were bought with a price; you are not your own; until you align your will to that of the creator, you will never reach your destiny in life. Be blessed!</p>
