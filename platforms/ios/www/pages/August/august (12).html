		  	<p><i>And they sold their possessions (both their landed property and their movable goods) and distributed the price among all, according as any had need. (Acts 2:45)</i></p>

		  	<blockquote>When there is no love, functionality is impaired; this invariably withholds success.</blockquote>

		  	<p>Love is sacrificial; it is demonstrated by the act of giving out something valuable, to meet the needs of another. It is an act of deliberately stepping out of your comfort zone for a while, to ensure that everyone else is comfortable.</p>
		  	<p>God’s love for the world was demonstrated by His act of giving His only Son, who in turn sacrificed His life in sin that we might live right.</p>
		  	<p>The believers of the early church demonstrated love towards one another, by selling off their properties, and sacrificing the price for those who were in need.</p>
		  	<p>Verily, if love does not sacrifice; if love does not give; then it is not love. For sacrifice is the nature of love.</p>
		  	<p>The believers of the early Church sold their landed and movable properties, not because they had no need of them, but because of love. Verily, these properties were valuable, and the owners still treasured them.</p>
		  	<p>I’m more convinced about love, when it has portrayed a vast extent of sacrifice.</p>
		  	<p>The believers of the early church never refrained from exhibiting love towards one another. They were devoted to the Word, filled with awe, and united in love. If love was lacking, all other efforts they made would have summed up to nullity.</p>
		  	<p>You cannot say that you are a member of the body of Christ, when you do not love. So far, we understand that the Church is a body devoted to the Word, filled with awe and reverence for God, and united in love. If any of these is lacking, then that body is sick.</p>
		  	<p>Beloved, to what extent are you ready to show love by sacrifice, for your neighbors? Love is what unites any organization or body together in harmony, when there is no love, functionality is impaired; this invariably withholds success.</p>
		  	<p>God is love; if you cannot love, then you have not discovered Christ yet. The Church is the body of Christ, without love, the body does not exist. In essence, if you cannot love, you are not His Church.</p>
		  	<p>Love is what binds any church, body or organization; when there is no love, the members are scattered in discord against one another, placing themselves in a vulnerable position.</p>
		  	<p>Let love be genuine; be ready to sacrifice; for greater things are laid ahead of you. Be blessed!</p>
