		  	<p><i>For if anyone only listens to the Word without obeying it and being a doer of it, he is like a man who looks carefully at his [own] natural face in a mirror;</i></p>
		  	<p><i>For he thoughtfully observes himself, and then goes off and promptly forgets what he was like. (James 1:23-24)</i></p>
		  	


		  	<blockquote>Stop taking actions based on people’s opinion – you will live to regret them; only act on God’s Word – it is true.</blockquote>

		  	<p>I recall years back, when I was younger; no matter how well I tried to convince my mum of her gorgeous looks, she will still gaze at the mirror for a confirmation. She was not satisfied with my praise, she probably felt I was just saying all of that to make her feel special; but she was convinced that only the mirror can reveal her exact image.</p>
		  	<p>The mirror gives a reflection of our looks; it reveals every contour of excessive make-up, bushy eye-brows, tangled lashes, and oily surfaces; as we gaze intently on these reflections, we are able to carve every brow, straighten the tangled lashes, and wipe oily surfaces to perfection.</p>
		  	<p>In this sense, the mirror is a tool used to put us back to shape, when we are shapeless; it is used to approve our corrections and confirm our paths. We no longer need to seek people’s opinion about our looks; we just need to behold the mirror to gain confidence.</p>
		  	<p>The Word of God is likened to a mirror that gives us a reflection of who we are. Hence, when you want to be directed, developed and enhanced, you don’t need to seek people’s opinion, but gaze at the mirror of life.</p>
		  	<p>Without the Word of God, a man will never realize his worth, ability and strength. He will always live under the mercy of the merciless critics.</p>
		  	<p>If there is any weakness in you, that needs to be dealt with, the Word of God reveals it; if there is any potential in you, that needs to be maximized, the Word of God reveals it; when you are caught up in dilemma, the Word of God is your direction. Only act upon it, and nothing else.</p>
		  	<p>Stop taking actions based on people’s opinion — you will live to regret them; only act on God’s Word—it is true. Understand that you are not who people say you are, but who God says you are. You are more than what the world has made of you.</p>
		  	<p>When people spell out your weaknesses to you; understand one thing — only the mirror can give the exact reflection; they are not your mirror, the Word of God is.</p>
		  	<p>It is not the world that should define or limit your ability, but God’s Word. The world made David to think that he was not able to face Goliath, but God’s Word convinced him that he could do all things. Don’t let the world limit your ability, let the Word of God convict and convince you.</p>
		  	<p>When Joseph gazed at his brothers, he saw inferiority; but when he gazed at the mirror of life, he saw royalty. Don’t be focused on the judgment from the world, but the revelations from the Word.</p>
		  	<p>Weigh your worth and value, in accordance with the reflections of the Word, and not the opinion of the world. Be blessed!</p>
