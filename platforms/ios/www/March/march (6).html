		  	<p><i>Through wisdom is an house builded; and by understanding it is established:</i></p>
		  	<p><i>And by knowledge shall the chambers be filled with all precious and pleasant riches. (Proverbs 24:3-4)</i></p>
		  

		  	<blockquote>Always be knowledgeable of your identity in Christ; except you know who you are, you will fall for anything. </blockquote>

		  	<p>There are just three things a man needs on earth, in order to have everything. Wealth, prosperity, success, and greatness are all encapsulated in the body of these three: Wisdom, Knowledge, and Understanding.</p>
		  	<p>The wisdom of God, which is at work in us, is what builds us up; by a deeper insight and understanding of the things of God, we become established; by revelation knowledge, we get fully loaded with benefits, and pleasant riches.</p>
		  	<p>A building, its establishment, and riches therein, are as a result of these three.</p>
		  	<p>We all desire to have a building, but it really matters how well that building is established. Buildings founded on sinking sand, collapse as a result of a light push of the wind, whereas, buildings that are well established on a rock, remains firm, amidst all storms, winds and forces.</p>
		  	<p>People have developed empires and structures; they have grown too wealthy for a lifetime, but within a twinkle of an eye, it all vanished in the air. Many have fallen from the palace to the pit; and from grace to grass. This is because; these fellows may not have been well established. They had a structure that lacked core establishment.</p>
		  	<p>Firm establishment is only brought about by understanding. The reason why many great men fall is lack of understanding. They had enough wisdom to build a house, but lacked the understanding to establish it properly.</p>
		  	<p>Solomon was one who asked God for nothing else but wisdom and understanding . . . What a great choice! In having wisdom, knowledge and understanding, he had everything. He became a huge success and there was nothing else which he lacked.</p>
		  	<p>Many Christians are still entangled in their struggle with sin, despite the fact that the wisdom of God is resident in us; the reason being the lack of in-depth understanding. They don’t open their bibles for months, and even if they do, they flip through without meditation, thus receiving no rhema from it. How can they expect to overcome?</p>
		  	<p>When we carefully meditate on the Word of God, receive Rhema, and declare it, our understanding is deepened, and we get strengthened and gradually established in Spirit.</p>
		  	<p>Furthermore, after all wisdom is gained, and all understanding is received, knowledge remains very essential. Wisdom and understanding could give you a well built and established mansion, but it is only knowledge that could stock it up with riches. Of what use is it, having a big mansion without a penny inside?</p>
		  	<p><i>My people are destroyed for lack of knowledge: because thou hast rejected knowledge, I will also reject thee (Hosea 4:6)</i></p>
		  	<p>Embrace knowledge! Refuse to be ignorant. Knowledge provides riches, while ignorance results in destruction. There is therefore no doubt that poverty is as a result of ignorance (lack of knowledge). It is impossible to be in the place of knowledge, and lack pleasant riches. Always be knowledgeable of your identity in Christ; except you know who you are, you will fall for anything.</p>
		  	<p>All three—wisdom, knowledge and understanding — are very essential. When you have wealth (knowledge), without a place to keep it (wisdom), it gets misplaced... A house (wisdom) that is not well established (understanding), collapses over time.</p>
		  	<p>In summary brethren, we are like houses; we need wisdom and understanding to be well built and strongly established in Christ. We also need knowledge to be richly garnished and fully loaded with benefits. With these three, our lives are made very blissful!</p>
		  	<p>Being in Christ, we have all these already. Never stop growing in wisdom, knowledge and understanding. Declare it always—I am a success!</p>
