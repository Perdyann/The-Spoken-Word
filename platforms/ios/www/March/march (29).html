		  	<p><i>Then he saith, I will return into my house from whence I came out; and when he is come, he findeth it empty, swept, and garnished. </i></p>
		  	<p><i>Then goeth he, and taketh with himself seven other spirits more wicked than himself, and they enter in and dwell there: and the last state of that man is worse than the first. Even so shall it be also unto this wicked generation. (Matthew 12:44-45)</i></p>

		  	<blockquote>When you deliberately shy away from the things of the spirit, you make yourself vulnerable to the attacks of the enemy</blockquote>

		  	<p>Emptiness results in misery! The truth, which many fail to comprehend, is that the body of man is never void of a Spirit. A man, who is not filled with the Holy Spirit, is an occupation of evil spirits.</p>
		  	<p>Light and darkness have no union whatsoever. Darkness can only penetrate into the heart of a man, when that heart lacks light.</p>
		  	<p>When you deliberately shy away from the things of the spirit, you make yourself vulnerable to the attacks of the enemy.</p>
		  	<p>So often, Christians speak of back-sliding. In a season, we are so sensitive, strong and agile spiritually, but over time, we may tend to realise that we don’t have so much passion, zeal and strength to do the things of the Spirit anymore.</p>
		  	<p>Prayer becomes a hard task. Reading the bible becomes a task of great struggle. Sooner than we know it, we are dry, Empty, and lacking. We then tend to need motivation, before we can do the things which we once did easily.</p>
		  	<p>Gradually, the light starts fading off, our cups start running dry, Our strength is gradually replaced by weaknesses of the flesh, The enemy starts creeping in, We then begin to hear more of evil voices, than the voice of God, The enemy begins to take advantage of us, It then dawns on us, we’ve backslidden!</p>
		  	<p>Beloved, this ought not to be the case. Paul said, “I die daily” (1 Corinthians 15:31). Indeed, we need to die daily, and receive a fresh pour of the Spirit every new day. Don’t be weary to pray and meditate.</p>
		  	<p>Give valuable time to prayers and meditation. Stir up your faith with the Word of God each day . . . Give no empty, garnished room, for the enemy to creep into. It is written,</p>
		  	<p><i>Be very careful, then, how you live—not as unwise but as wise, making the most of every opportunity, because the days are evil. (Ephesians 5:15-16) NIV</i></p>
		  	<p>Invest your time wisely, edify your Spirit always, and never be empty! Be blessed!</p>
