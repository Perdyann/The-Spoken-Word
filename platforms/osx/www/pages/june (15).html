		  	<p><i>In Him was Life, and the Life was the Light of men.</i></p>
		  	<p><i>And the Light shines on in the darkness, for the darkness has never overpowered it [put it out or absorbed it or appropriated it, and is unreceptive to it]. (John 1:4-5)</i></p>
		  	

		  	<blockquote>He said “Let there be light” Many years have come and gone, but that Word of God has never, and will never lose its power! </blockquote>

		  	<p>Darkness cannot overcome light! Reading through the book of Genesis 1, we realize that in the earth, which was filled with darkness, and was without form, God created light. The creation of light is very significant.</p>
		  	<p>Light was the first thing to be created; the earth had many other issues asides darkness—It was without form; but of all the issues God wanted to address on the state of the earth, He prioritized light. Before He could start giving the earth form, and separating the skies, water, and land, He had to address the issue of darkness.</p>
		  	<p>He said “Let there be light” Many years have come and gone, but that Word of God has never, and will never lose its power!</p>
		  	<p>Another significant aspect of the creation of light is—As soon as God saw that light was good, the first thing He did was to separate it from darkness. (Genesis 1:5) It was not until that was accomplished, that He began to create the firmament and everything else.</p>
		  	<p>This portrays the importance of separation of light from darkness. Paul confirmed this in 2 Corinthians 6:14, when he boldly declared that light has no fellowship or communion with darkness.</p>
		  	<p>The Gospel of John was introduced by a recollection of the beginning. It states that since then, darkness has never overpowered light.</p>
		  	<p>Verily beloved, we are convinced by God’s Word that darkness has no power, advantage and strength over light. The power that oozed out millenniums ago, when God created light, will never be overcome by darkness.</p>
		  	<p>Beloved, we are the light of the world; we are that city set up on the hill that cannot be hid; amidst the gross darkness of the world, we outshine in all lucidity.</p>
		  	<p>Here’s the point, as long as the Word of God has never and will never lose its power, you can never be overcome by darkness.</p>
		  	<p>All have sinned, and fallen short of the glory of God; at some point in our lives, we might have walked in the dark, we might have been ignorant, we might have fallen, we might have made mistakes, we might have been caught up with the evil we did not want to do, we might have acted in the flesh and not the Spirit.</p>
		  	<p>Embrace this truth today, “darkness cannot overcome light!”</p>
		  	<p>I know that even as the light, I have at one point fallen short of His glory; but because of the Power of God’s Word, darkness could not still overshadow me. I fell severally, but constantly rose with a greater illumination.</p>
		  	<p>Darkness, which is portrayed in sin, filthiness, carnality, and worldliness, has struggled through millenniums to hide the light, but has always failed.</p>
		  	<p>In our work places, in our institutions, and in the world at large, we encounter agents of darkness, who endlessly try to lure us to compromise our faith and stand in God for temporal worldly pleasures.</p>
		  	<p>Never mingle with such personalities; light and darkness has no communion or fellowship whatsoever. Always represent light; keep shinning, so that men may see your good works, and glorify the Father.</p>
		  	<p>The light of God, which illuminates from within our spirit has always and will forever put to subjection the deeds of the flesh. Cheer up, darkness might struggle and try, but can never overcome light, as long as the Word of God lives. Be blessed!</p>
