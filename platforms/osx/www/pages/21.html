		  	<p><i>And Jesus sat over against the treasury, and beheld how the people cast money into the treasury: and many that were rich cast in much.</i></p>
		  	<p><i>And there came a certain poor widow, and she threw in two mites, which make a farthing.</i></p>
		  	<p><i>And he called unto him his disciples, and saith unto them, Verily I say unto you, That this poor widow hath cast more in, than all they which have cast into the treasury:</i></p>
		  	<p><i>For all they did cast in of their abundance; but she of her want did cast in all that she had, even all her living. (Mark 12:41-44)</i></p>


		  	<blockquote>In the eyes of God, the magnitude of your gift is not the amount, but the sacrifice and heart.</blockquote>

		  	<p>This passage particularly opens my eye to the truth that in the eyes of God, the value of our gifts is not based on its quantity, but on the level of sacrifice, and the heart from which it was given. Here’s a situation where the rich made huge donations, and behold a poor widow merely giving two coins which happens to be her last. In the eyes of God, she gave the most.</p>
		  	<p>In some congregations, specific quotes and figures are given as to amounts which should be sowed. At some point, God began to make me to understand that He doesn’t see things like men see. We evaluate the social and economic worth of the figures given, but God’s measuring tool of the value of any gift, focuses on the level of sacrifice.</p>
		  	<p>God does not accept all gifts! And the screening on gifts to be accepted is done not based on quantity but the heart and sacrifice. Cain made and offering, and so did Abel; but the Lord respected one and disregarded the other. Don’t let your gift be among those that will be disregarded by God.</p>
		  	<p>It is more blessed to give than to receive. Always be happy to give. When you’re offering a gift, ensure that you’re in good relationship with your brethren (Matthew 5:23-24). Offer richly as unto God and not unto man.</p>
		  	<p>Sacrifice is an act of forfeiting or giving up something for the sake of a better cause. Abel was able to sacrifice his fatter rams. He forfeited his own satisfaction to please the Father; the widow dropped in her last two coins; she sacrificed her living to give to the work of God. Always be ready to go an extra-mile to please the Father.</p>
		  	<p>Above all, understand that in the eyes of God, the magnitude of your gift is not the amount, but the sacrifice and heart. Be blessed!</p>
