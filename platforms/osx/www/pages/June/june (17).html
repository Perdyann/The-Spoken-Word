		  	<p><i>For God hath not given us the spirit of fear; but of power, and of love, and of a sound mind. (2Timothy 1:7)</i></p>
		  	


		  	<blockquote>You are more powerful than you think you are; don’t act timid, live like you’ve got the power.</blockquote>

		  	<p>Over recent years, there has been a dramatic increase in the rate of terrorist attacks, natural disasters, economic breakdowns, and unprecedented calamity; these ill circumstances have cut across all the continents of the world. Even the nations thought to be well established and secure, have been gripped by an unexpected catastrophe. This has created fear in the hearts of many men.</p>
		  	<p>Many have lost their loved ones, many have lost their possessions and many have lost their jobs; these fellows are gripped by the fear of having to lose even more.</p>
		  	<p>When I spare a moment to recall but a few disastrous events, I am moved to a point of tears . . . as a result of the effect of these incidents, many have embraced timidity; the actions of many are now motivated by fear and not faith. If only they knew this Word, everything will be much easier to handle.</p>
		  	<p>The Word of God makes us to understand that the spirit we have received is that of power, love and sound mind, and not of fear. Verily, we are greater than our fears.</p>
		  	<p><b><i>The Spirit of Power!</i></b> In receiving the Holy Spirit, we have received Power, Authority, Divine enablement and Strength. In essence, we have power over terrorism, economic breakdown, natural disasters, and all other ill circumstances. When you understand that the Spirit in you is greater than the challenges in the world, you will never harbor fear again.</p>
		  	<p>Verily beloved, you are more powerful than you think you are; don’t act timid, live like you’ve got the power.</p>
		  	<p><b><i>The Spirit of love!</i></b> The love of God has been shed abroad in our hearts. To what extent is the love of God in your heart expressed? Man, who is selfish by nature, is translated to a loving being, by the Power of the Holy Ghost.</p>
		  	<p>You will be surprised how selfish people can act, when confronted with danger; the fear of evil could make many denounce their neighbors’ ... but that shouldn’t be the case of a born-again man. We have received the spirit of love; anyone that does not love is not of God.</p>
		  	<p><b><i>The Spirit of a sound mind!</i></b> Other versions quote self discipline or self control.</p>
		  	<p>Fear has ripped many off their sanity, their ability to act right, and remain disciplined. People no longer think rightly, but let their thoughts be channeled by fear. That should not be the case.</p>
		  	<p>Your mind is the channel that directs the course of your life; if your mind is ever ripped of its soundness, then the mobility and course of your life is impaired. Never let fear to control your thinking.</p>
		  	<p>Beloved, if only you can realize how great the Spirit you have in you is, you will never respond in timidity. You are greater than all your fears. Be blessed!</p>
