		  	<p><i>So David prevailed over the Philistine with a sling and with a stone, and smote the Philistine, and slew him; but there was no sword in the hand of David. (1 Samuel 17:50)</i></p>
		  	
		  	<blockquote>When the world puts their trust in the sword, put your trust in the Word. What you cannot achieve with the sword, you can achieve with the Word. </blockquote>

		  	<p>There’s something really amazing about this verse; Although David already had intentions of beheading Goliath, he never went for the battle with a sword. Looking intently at this scripture, I wondered, “How then did he think he could behead him?”</p>
		  	<p>That’s the difference between a carnal man, and a Spirit minded man. Saul believed that in order for David to win the battle, he needed to be well armed with sophisticated weapons; David thought differently; he was convinced that he did not need to go with a sword, in order to behead Goliath.</p>
		  	<p>Beloved, to be a success, you need to learn how to think differently! When the world puts their trust in the sword, put your trust in the Word. What you cannot achieve with the sword, you can achieve with the Word.</p>
		  	<p>Everyone else looked at the sword as the weapon, without which victory cannot be gained; David saw it differently; He regarded the name of God as his weapon of victory.</p>
		  	<p>That’s just the same way a lot of people regard some resources; they think that without money, you really can’t achieve success in any project; The truth the fail to realize is, not all projects are sponsored by finances; some are sponsored by favor.</p>
		  	<p>Although David did not have a sword of his own, he was able to behead Goliath with his sword. Likewise, you might not have enough resources for your project; but that doesn’t stop the vision from being a success; it could be financed by another.</p>
		  	<p>Beloved, even when you don’t have enough resources for your project initially, never let your target and goals be compromised. As long as that project satisfies God’s purpose for your life, it cannot but be a success.</p>
		  	<p>You can defeat the giants in your life, even without spending a dime to purchase a sword; You can still do great things, without falling into financial crises; People think you cannot achieve so much with money, but that’s false. With God you can do anything.</p>
		  	<p>People of the world may not be able to purchase houses without money, but sons of God live in houses they did not build. Favor can get you something that money cannot. The anointing of God on David granted him victory, even without a sword.</p>
		  	<p>When you have God, you no longer need any sword to be victorious.</p>
		  	<p>Stop placing too much value on the sword, you can do without it. Rather, exalt God over everything else. Be blessed!</p>
