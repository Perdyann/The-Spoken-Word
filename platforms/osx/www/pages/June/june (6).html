		  	<p><i>Whereas thou has been forsaken and hated, so that no man went through thee, I will make thee an eternal excellency, a joy of many generations. (Isaiah 60:15)</i></p>


		  	<blockquote>You don’t deserve to be tortured in trying to force people to stay in your life; there is a time to welcome, and a time to say goodbye. </blockquote>

		  	<p>Some people come into your life at some seasons, and some others walk out in like manner. Sometimes, we feel quite sad to let people go; we keep clinging unto them to see if we can convince them to walk back in; we cannot imagine how life will be without these fellows;</p>
		  	<p>But have you ever thought, ‘are they really worth it?’ What we fail to realize most times is that we are better off without some people. God might have something greater ahead of you, but as long as you keep clinging unto what you have, you cannot receive the greater thing God wants to give you.</p>
		  	<p>You don’t deserve to be tortured in trying to force people to stay in your life. You should learn to bid farewell to those who have chosen to walk out.</p>
		  	<p>For years I struggled to keep some people in my life, ministry and affairs, because I couldn’t imagine moving on without them. In no time, I realized that there is a time to welcome, and a time to say goodbye.</p>
		  	<p>We must understand that there is a time for everything. Don’t get depressed when people walk away from you; there is joy in being forsaken by men, but embraced by God.</p>
		  	<p>When the arm of flesh had failed me; when all my friends had walked away; when everyone had deserted me. I walked into the arms of my Father; I have never experienced such warmth, joy and peace as I did in the His arms.</p>
		  	<p>I may never have found such joy and comfort if I had not been forsaken. Sometimes, it takes a man to be forsaken to realize what he has; sometimes we need to be deserted by that, which we have clung unto, to realize the greater value of what we have overlooked.</p>
		  	<p>There is indeed joy in being forsaken; I thank God that I was forsaken previously, because that molded me to be a better person; just when people gave up on me and walked away, God took me to an entirely new level.</p>
		  	<p>If they had not walked away, I might not be who I am today.</p>
		  	<p>However, there is one thing I observed; the very people that gave up on you, and walked away, will one day come back seeking you; the mouth that spoke evil of you, will surely speak good.</p>
		  	<p>When Joseph’s brothers sold him and walked away, they never thought they’d ever need him again; but when God had exalted him, those same betrayers travelled miles to see the fellow whom they once forsook. Indeed, there is joy in being forsaken!</p>
		  	<p>We are assured by the reason of this Powerful Word, that though we have at one point in life been forsaken and left alone, we will be made the joy of many generations.</p>
		  	<p>Rejoice when you have been forsaken and despised by men, for God will create an entirely new message out of your mess. Be blessed!</p>
