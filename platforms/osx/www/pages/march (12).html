		  	<p><i>And when they came to Nachon’s threshingfloor, Uzzah put forth his hand to the ark of God, and took hold of it; for the oxen shook it.</i></p>
		  	<p><i>And the anger of the LORD was kindled against Uzzah; and God smote him there for his error; and there he died by the ark of God. (2 Samuel 6:6-7)</i></p>


		  	<blockquote>Don’t try to substitute the might of God, with your physical arms. Never attempt to play the role of God.</blockquote>

		  	<p>So much crossed my mind as I meditated on this passage, just to think of it, what was Uzzah’s intention when he held the ark of God? Did he really mean to act against the law? His action was probably reflex.</p>
		  	<p>Indeed, Uzzah acted the way he did, with the best intention. He only tried to prevent the ark of God from falling down. The oxen shook it, and he felt that if he did not take a hold of it, it may have crashed down to the earth.</p>
		  	<p>The only mistake of Uzzah was the failure to realize that he could not help God against His laws. The only condemnation of Uzzah was the law! Why did that singular act lead to Uzzah’s death?</p>
		  	<p>Brethren, I presume that many of us, even in this age, have done worse things in a bid to help God against His will, yet we were not struck dead. Uzzah’s action was probably not a deliberate attempt to contradict the law of God, whereas, men of this age have consciously acted against the will of God, yet weren’t struck dead.</p>
		  	<p>Beloved, we are in the era of grace. Uzzah was in the era of the law. From the law emanates slavery, transgression and death; however, from grace proceeds freedom and life.</p>
		  	<p>Should we now abuse grace? Paul addressed this issue in his letter to the Romans, he said:</p>
		  	<p><i>“What shall we say then? Shall we continue in sin, that grace may abound? God forbid . . .” (Romans 6:1-2)</i></p>
		  	<p>Beloved, whether in the era of law or grace, never try to help God! Uzzah foreknew that he really wasn’t qualified to hold the ark of God, but he didn’t trust God enough to prevent the ark from falling, thus, he attempted to use his own strength to keep it from falling.</p>
		  	<p>God has the power and authority to cause anything to fall, or be held up high. Trust the power of God to work out situations for you. Don’t try to substitute the might of God, with your physical arms.</p>
		  	<p>How often have we acted against the Word of God, in a bid to stop things from occurring against our wish? How often have we tried to work out situations by our ability, without trusting the Word of God?</p>
		  	<p>We must understand that our affairs matter to God, much more than they concern us. We don’t need to play the role of God! Just have this Word always:</p>
		  	<p><i>Be still, and know that I am God: I will be exalted among the heathen, I will be exalted in the earth. (Psalm 46:10)</i></p>
		  	<p>It doesn’t matter what kind of challenges and trials you are going through. Just like the ark, your life, marriage and affairs might seem like they are about to fall and crumble.</p>
		  	<p>Don’t attempt to use your physical arms and strength, against God’s will, in a bid to preserve your marriage, academics or reputation. Let God be God over your life. Be still. Never attempt to play the role of God! Be blessed!</p>
