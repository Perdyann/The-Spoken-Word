		  	<p><i>O generation of vipers, how can ye, being evil, speak good things? for out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaketh.</i></p>
		  	<p><i>A good man out of the good treasure of the heart bringeth forth good things: and an evil man out of the evil treasure bringeth forth evil things.</i></p>
		  	<p><i>But I say unto you, That every idle word that men shall speak, they shall give account thereof in the day of judgment.</i></p>
		  	<p><i>For by thy words thou shalt be justified, and by thy words thou shalt be condemned. (Matthew 12:34-37)</i></p>

		  	<blockquote>I don’t need to have lived with you for a million years to know you; I just need to hear you speak. Our words are traitors; they reveal the innate secrets of the heart. </blockquote>

		  	<p>I don’t need to have lived with you for a million years to know you; I just need to hear you speak. There is nothing that defines a man as much as his words.</p>
		  	<p>Our words are traitors; they reveal the innate secrets of the heart. Whether evil or good, our words have the capacity to either edify or destroy us. Can our words really justify us?</p>
		  	<p>Well, according to this passage, yes! Our Words can speak justification for us. In essence, no man is liable to condemnation unless by his words, likewise, we are justified if our words are aimed at edification.</p>
		  	<p>Words are powerful! Whether evil or good, our words have the ability to either make or break us. As long as you can speak the right words, you can have a great life.</p>
		  	<p>To what extent have our words enriched the lives of those around us? The Word of God says, </p>
		  	<p><i> But I say unto you, That every idle word that men shall speak, they shall give account thereof in the day of judgment. (vs. 36)</i></p>
		  	<p>What are idle words? These are careless words without purpose. Beloved, if your words will not edify, be quiet!</p>
		  	<p>As Children of God, our words have power, there are angels assigned to manifest our spoken words. A child of destiny should not speak anyhow. Utter power! Speak life!</p>
		  	<p>Don’t speak of illnesses, failures and defeat; even when the situations around us reflect all these. Always speak the Word.</p>
		  	<p>God created the earth with Words of Power . . . We have a calling to transform the world by our spoken words. There is nothing that limits the words of a man of faith. Little wonder it is written,</p>
		  	<p><i>“ ... If ye have faith as a grain of mustard seed, ye shall say unto this mountain, Remove hence to yonder place; and it shall remove; and nothing shall be impossible unto you.” (Matthew 17:20)</i></p>
		  	<p>Notice that Jesus didn’t propel them to uproot a mountain by their arms and strength, but by their words of faith.</p>
		  	<p>Beloved, even as we study daily to build our faith, we must also equip ourselves with the right words. By faith, we can speak health to sick bodies, and they shall recover. We can speak life to dead bodies, and they shall rise. We can say a word of power and it shall be established unto us. Your words are powerful; speak right!</p>
