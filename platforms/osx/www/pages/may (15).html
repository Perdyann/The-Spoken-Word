		  <div class="panel-body" style="text-align:justify">


		  	<p><i>And they were all filled with the Holy Ghost, and began to speak with other tongues, as the Spirit gave them utterance. (Acts 2:4)</i></p>

		  	<blockquote>Praying in tongues is a gift of the Holy Ghost; I really don’t think the Holy Spirit will distribute gifts which are not important.</blockquote>

		  	<p>Over recent years, different myths and doctrines about speaking in tongues have developed, causing many to doubt its importance.</p>
		  	<p>When you pray in your understanding, you create your own utterance, but when you pray in tongues, the Spirit gives you utterance.</p>
		  	<p>Praying in tongues is a gift of the Holy Ghost; I really don’t think the Holy Spirit will distribute gifts which are not important. In precisely elaborating the importance of tongues, I will make personal references.</p>
		  	<p>Some time ago, I desired the gift of tongues because I understood a little about it. As I sat in church during a week day prayer meeting, my Pastor discussed the gift of tongues, and towards the end of the message, he said, “Receive it!”</p>
		  	<p>It was in a very small and stuffy meeting room, but the moment he uttered those two words, there was such a gentle cool breeze that gushed upon me. I looked around, but couldn’t see any possible source of fresh air, it was amazing.</p>
		  	<p>I did not fully understand what happened until I heard someone sharing his experience about how he received the gift of praying in tongues; it was exactly the same experience. I did not start to speak in tongues right there in Church, but I knew I had the ability to do so. My sister shared more truth with me, and that night, we prayed fervidly in tongues at home.</p>
		  	<p>Beloved, that was one of the best experiences of my life. Speaking in tongues strengthened my prayer life. Previously, when I prayed in my understanding only, I could hardly spend five minutes with God. But when I prayed in the Spirit, I lost consciousness of time, I felt transposed to another realm of joy; it really does edify.</p>
		  	<p>Have you ever prayed fervidly in your understanding, and you approached a certain juncture when you could not express yourself in your language of understanding anymore? There is a realm that only tongues can break into.</p>
		  	<p>When you pray with your understanding alone, you only speak of things you are aware of in the physical realm. But when you pray in tongues, the Holy Spirit gives you utterances, and you, unknowingly, may be averting some evil schemes and plans. When you pray in tongues, you utter spiritual mysteries... (1 Corinthians 14:2)</p>
		  	<p>The only language the devil does not understand is the language of the Spirit. When you pray in tongues, he is caught unawares.</p>
		  	<p>A lot of people think that Paul, in 1 Corinthians 14, was preaching against tongues; he was not! He only spelt out the preeminence of prophecy over tongues.</p>
		  	<p><i>He that speaketh in an unknown tongue edifieth himself; but he that prophesieth edifieth the church. (1 Corinthians 14:4)</i></p>
		  	<p>Verily, Paul was only giving light to the priority of prophecy over speaking in tongues. Before you can be strong enough to edify and bear up a church with you, you must be edified. As much as God desires us to be a blessing to His church, he wants us to be edified (built-up and grown).</p>
		  	<p>Sometimes, when we pray in tongues, we receive the interpretation. Beloved, praying in tongues plays a major role in self-edification. When you are lured and enticed by your sinful desires, spare a moment and pray in tongues; when you wake up in the morning, pray in tongues; when you feel that deep urge to pray, but don’t know what to pray about, pray in tongues!</p>
		  	<p>At every season and time of the day, pray in the Holy Ghost; many things happen when we utter spiritual mysteries. Be blessed!</p>
