		  	<p><i>For our light, momentary affliction (this slight distress of the passing hour) is ever more and more abundantly preparing and producing and achieving for us an everlasting weight of glory [beyond all measure, excessively surpassing all comparisons and all calculations, a vast and transcendent glory and blessedness never to cease!], (2 Corinthians 4:17 AMP)</i></p>
		  	


		  	<blockquote>Your afflictions cannot last as long as the glory that comes with it... problems don’t last as long as promises. </blockquote>

		  	<p>People have attained very great heights of glory, yet encountered something that brought them lower than they started. Those who have gone up have also come down. We have seen glory burst forth in brightness, and we have seen it fade away in dimness.</p>
		  	<p>Where can we find such glory that never fades? Where can we encounter such glory that lasts forever?</p>
		  	<p>Our main point of emphasis in this scripture today, is the everlasting weight of glory. From the word everlasting, we can tell that it is a glory that lasts forever, and fades not.</p>
		  	<p>However, there is a prerequisite for attaining such heights of glory in God. Get ready to stand firm, even in afflictions. Before every glory, there is a slight distress of the passing hour.</p>
		  	<p>Just like the hours count and pass by, so does our affliction pass away with time. The righteous is afflicted, but delivered in no time.</p>
		  	<p>Your afflictions cannot last as long as the glory that comes with it. The afflictions are momentary and temporal, while the glory is everlasting. Why then should your focus be on the temporal trial, and not the everlasting glory?</p>
		  	<p>When you understand how temporal the affliction is, you will cease to focus on it, and start looking forward to the everlasting weight of glory.</p>
		  	<p>Not only is this glory everlasting, it is immeasurable, incalculable, incomprehensible, vast and unfading. It is a glory that does not diminish over time, but appreciates every second.</p>
		  	<p>There is a price for such a degree of glory; it is holding unto the Word of Truth, against all oppression, afflictions and trials. It was for this glory, which was set before Jesus, that He endured the cross, despising the shame. Hebrews 12:2</p>
		  	<p>When you set your focus on the unfading glory, you will endure much more than you ever thought you could; you will receive strength to carry on.</p>
		  	<p>Understand that your affliction is just a phase of preparation that does not last long, but the glory that comes after is incomprehensibly everlasting. Cheer up; problems don’t last as long as promises. Be blessed!</p>
