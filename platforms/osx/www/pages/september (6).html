		  	<p><i>Now when Daniel knew that the writing was signed, he went into his house; and his windows being open in his chamber toward Jerusalem, he kneeled upon his knees three times a day, and prayed, and gave thanks before his God, as he did aforetime. (Daniel 6:10)</i></p>
		  	

		  	<blockquote>If you have not learnt to be motivated by threats, you will always be limited by them. </blockquote>

		  	<p>Daniel had always prayed and given thanks to God; his gifts had made way for him, and he was highly reputable. He was preferred above the presidents and princes; for this reason, they sought to find a fault against him; when they could not, they persuaded the king to sign a petition to the end that no one should pray to God.</p>
		  	<p>They expected their new statute to keep Daniel from praying; they thought that they could threaten him by the new rule. However, this new rule was more of a motivation than a threat to Daniel.</p>
		  	<p>As the scripture rightly states, when Daniel knew that such a petition was signed, he went and prayed, leaving his window open. I think he intentionally left his window open.</p>
		  	<p>Notice the first phrase of this passage — <i>Now when Daniel knew that the writing was signed,</i> In essence, it was not until he knew that the writing had been signed, that he went to pray, leaving his windows open.</p>
		  	<p>Daniel had always prayed three times daily, but with the signing of this new rule, it was expected that he would pray secretly, to avoid being cast into the lion’s den. That was not the case—this threat rather motivated him, to hold onto his standards, without compromising.</p>
		  	<p>By this action, he proved that no threat was frightening enough, to keep him from communicating with God always.</p>
		  	<p>Daniel did not mind losing his friendship with the king, for the sake of God; he did not mind being persecuted for the sake of God; he did not mind losing his life for the sake of God. What can you give up for the sake of God?</p>
		  	<p>Beloved, we will be tested in every way to prove the extent to which we trust in God. There are circumstances that will rise to threaten our friendship with our confidants; our bond with our family might be threatened by diverse trials.</p>
		  	<p>If you have not learnt to be motivated by threats, you will always be limited by them.</p>
		  	<p>Don’t derail because of the height of persecutions, rather, be motivated by such threats. Be blessed!</p>
