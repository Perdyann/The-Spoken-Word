		  	<h5><strong>FAITH: The corresponding action to what you believe.</strong></h5>
		  	
		  	<p><i>And Jesus went with him; and a great crowd kept following Him and pressed Him from all sides [so as almost to suffocate Him].</i></p>
		  	<p><i>And there was a woman who had had a flow of blood for twelve years,</i></p>
		  	<p><i>For she kept saying, If I only touch His garments, I shall be restored to health.</i></p>
		  	<p><i>And immediately her flow of blood was dried up at the source, and [suddenly] she felt in her body that she was healed of her [distressing] ailment.</i></p>
		  	<p><i>And Jesus, recognizing in Himself that the power proceeding from Him had gone forth, turned around immediately in the crowd and said, Who touched My clothes? (Mark 5:24-25 & 28-30 AMP)</i></p>
		  


		  	<blockquote>No matter what challenge life presents to you, always remember that it is not more than your faith can handle!</blockquote>

		  	<p>There is no greater shame, than being addressed by your plague rather than your name. The woman with the issue of blood was hardly ever addressed by her real name, but by her predicament. Here’s how she translated her believing to faith.</p>
		  	<p>Faith is the corresponding action to what you believe! “If I only touch His garments, I shall be restored to health” This exact line portrays what the woman believed. It’s possible for someone to think this way without even acting . . . We understand from previous study, that by believing, all things are made possible, but beloved, there is something greater than believing... it is Faith!</p>
		  	<p>Believing makes all things possible, but it is only faith that manifests all possibilities. In essence, from the moment that woman believed in her healing, it became possible, and her breakthrough commenced, but when her believing propelled her to take the act of faith and push through the crowd, her breakthrough and healing was finalized. Don’t just stop at believing . . . Act faith!</p>
		  	<p>Belief is a thought of the heart, but faith is an act. The thought is not enough to produce the desired result; it is the act that crowns the thought with fulfilment. The moment your believing translates into faith, you have made it!</p>
		  	<p>There is something stunning I observed from this passage that swept me off my feet. When Jesus noticed that power had been released from Him, He asked, <i> “Who touched My clothes?” This question did not seem reasonable to his disciples, because obviously, the crowd pressed Him from all sides [so as almost to suffocate Him]. (vs. 24) </i> The disciples had to remind Him that it is impossible to ascertain the individual that touched Him, for almost everyone was presently touching Him. It says,</p>
		  	<p><i>“And the disciples kept saying to Him, You see the crowd pressing hard around You from all sides, and You ask, Who touched Me?” (vs. 31)</i></p>
		  	<p>In essence, the woman with the issue of blood was not the only one that touched Jesus, but she was the only one that got healed as a result. This goes to portray the fact that the healing did not rest in the garment of Jesus, but the faith of the woman who touched Him. This was confirmed when Jesus said to her,</p>
		  	<p><i>...Daughter, thy faith hath made thee whole; go in peace, and be whole of thy plague. (Mark 5:34)</i></p>
		  	<p>Jesus never said, ‘my garment has made thee whole’ He referred to her faith, as the source of her healing, because verily, many others touched His garment, but it did not profit them as much, not being mixed with faith.</p>
		  	<p>Beloved, whenever you act in faith, you achieve results that others were not privileged enough to get. Many people are ill, and they believe that they will get healed soon. Well, believing is not enough to fetch healing, but Faith is. FAITH is the corresponding action to what you believe.</p>
		  	<p>It is faith that rises and puts ill situations in the past. It is Faith that makes a sick man to rise and declare boldly, ‘I am healed!’ thereby putting his ailment in the past. Your breakthrough begins with your decision to believe, but it is only perfected by the act of faith.</p>
		  	<p>No matter what challenge life presents to you, always remember that it is not more than your faith can handle! Be blessed!</p>
