		  	<p><i>And having shod your feet in preparation [to face the enemy with the firm-footed stability, the promptness, and the readiness produced by the good news] of the Gospel of peace. (Ephesians 6:15 AMP)</i></p>
		 

		  	<blockquote>The gospel of peace is what gives a man firm-footed stability; Victory can never be achieved without stability. </blockquote>

		  	<p>Paul admonishes us to put on the whole armour of God; he did not say some, or a part, but the whole armour of God. Recently, we have studied the foundation of truth, and the breastplate of righteousness. However, these two are only a part.</p>
		  	<p>Your loins might be well wrapped up with truth, and your chest, guarded with the breastplate of righteousness; but you must understand that you are not yet putting on the whole armour of God. You are only equipped partly, and not fully; thus, you remain vulnerable and prone to all forms of attack.</p>
		  	<p>Therefore, having done all to balance the baseline of truth and grasp your righteous stand, clothe your feet with the gospel of peace, so that you might be able to stand strong.</p>
		  	<p>Peace simply means freedom from disturbance; it is a state of stillness, quietness and tranquility; a realm of rest! He who receives the gospel of peace shall cease from all his struggles, and receive rest.</p>
		  	<p>The gospel of peace is what gives a man firm-footed stability; The foot is what the whole body stands on, if it is not firm and stable, the whole body is unstable and shaky.</p>
		  	<p>The gospel of peace and not of war; the gospel of peace and not of condemnation is what gives stability in all spheres. If an unstable man were to stand in a warfront, or engage in a battle, his defeat is certain. Victory can never be achieved without stability.</p>
		  	<p>Your stability proves how firm you are; when a man is unstable, he can easily be tossed to and fro by every wind of doctrine; when a man is unstable (not firm), he can easily be moved by petty trials. It takes firmness to remain standing against all odds.</p>
		  	<p>When Jesus called Peter to walk with Him on the water, in no time Peter began to sink at the sight of the storms. Why? Peter was not stable in faith. He was still double-minded, trying to have a blend of faith and fear. As much as he tried to believe, he doubted; thus he lost stability.</p>
		  	<p>When you are firm and stable, you will easily walk through the storm, which has drowned those before you. Stability is important, and its origin is the gospel of peace.</p>
		  	<p>There are seasons in life when I overcame the most unbelievable trial; what gave me the stability and firmness? The gospel of peace!</p>
		  	<p>Find stability in this gospel always, and be readily prepared to take it to all corners of the earth. Jesus blessed as many as He came across with the gospel of peace—“Peace be unto you.”</p>
		  	<p>When Jesus commissioned the seventy, He sent them with the gospel of peace, telling them to bless every house they enter into with peace, and if it is not received, peace will be returned to them (Luke 10:5-6).</p>
		  	<p>What do we do with our feet? I believe we don’t stand still all day long, we move. Likewise, we shouldn’t keep the gospel of peace to ourselves, but take it round to all the corners of the earth. Be blessed!</p>
