		  	<p><i>And hope maketh not ashamed; because the love of God is shed abroad in our hearts by the Holy Ghost which is given unto us. (Romans 5:5)</i></p>

		  	<blockquote>God is love, love does not exist without God. No man has the ability to do right, to love or be perfect outside God. </blockquote>

		  	<p>Sometime ago, I was involved in a discussion with a colleague on the train. He expressed his feeling about religion, and his stand against it. Before he could go further, I made him understand the difference between religion and spirituality. God does not want us to be religious, but spiritual.</p>
		  	<p>He continued, stating that he felt it is best to live right, love, not get on anyone nerves, and just be good, without necessarily going deep into spiritual things. At this juncture, I interrupted stating, “You do not have the ability to love, live right, be good, and not get on anyone’s nerves.”</p>
		  	<p>Verily, God is love, love does not exist without God; this is hard to admit, but very true. We may try by our human efforts to be good to our friends, and help in times of need. But human love is limited; it binds friends alone, however, God’s love is unlimited and unconditional.</p>
		  	<p>God’s love does not look at the color of the skin; neither does it consider friendship before it’s activated. God’s love has no limits and conditions attached to it. The ability of a man to give up his life, and act selfless, in order to redeem a stranger or an enemy, is only but a demonstration of God’s love.</p>
		  	<p>Just as the scripture states, it is only the Holy Ghost, which is given to us, that is capable of shedding the love of God abroad in our hearts. In essence, it is impossible to have that love in your heart when the Holy Ghost is absent in your body.</p>
		  	<p>Just like we do not have the ability to love outside of God, we also don’t have the ability to act right outside of God. Righteousness is a gift we receive when we get born-again; except a man is born-again, he cannot be righteous.</p>
		  	<p>It is only the Holy Ghost, functioning in us that can guide us in the path of righteousness. No man has the ability to do right, to love or be perfect outside God.</p>
		  	<p>Beloved, yield to the Holy Spirit; He alone can lead us into our purpose and destiny in life. Be blessed!</p>
