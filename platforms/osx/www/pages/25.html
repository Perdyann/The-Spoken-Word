		  	<p><i>Moses answered the people, “Do not be afraid. Stand firm and you will see the deliverance the Lord will bring you today. The Egyptians you see today you will never see again. The Lord will fight for you; you need only to be still.” (Exodus 14:13-14 NIV)</i></p>
		  	

		  	<blockquote>Our liberation is eternal, we are free, not to be enslaved again.</blockquote>

		  	<p>Our Deliverance has come today! Hear ye the Word of the Lord, “The Egyptians you see today, you will see them no more.”</p>
		  	<p>Egyptians are not necessarily a nation or country. It signifies anything or body that has deprived you of freedom; it portrays any union that has held you captive and enslaved you. Today, the Word of the Lord gives us an absolute assurance that we shall no longer encounter captivity, slavery or freedom depravity.</p>
		  	<p>Not only do the Egyptians refer to bodies of captivity, it encompasses mountains which you’ve fought for so long to overcome. It refers to ill situations in which you find yourself caught up, without a means of escape.</p>
		  	<p>God assures us in His Word today, that He will make a message out of our mess. He will lead us from that place of bondage to a realm of absolute freedom.</p>
		  	<p>Never will we see the Egyptians of today again... Never will we encounter the hindrances of today again... Never will we be faced with the mountains of today again... Never will we be held captive, and enslaved again. Indeed, the Egyptians of today are defeated already!</p>
		  	<p>Furthermore, <i>the Lord will fight for you; you need only to be still (vs. 14).</i> Don’t fret, don’t panic, be anxious for nothing.</p>
		  	<p>The battle is not yours, it is for the Lord. We need only to be still, confident and courageous. The bible says,</p>
		  	<p><i>“If the Son therefore shall make you free, ye shall be free indeed. (John 8:36)</i></p>
		  	<p>Rejoice beloved, for we are free, and the challenges of today shall we encounter no more! For the Lord has made us free. Our liberation is eternal, we are free, not to be enslaved again.</p>
		  	<p>Whatsoever has held you bound in life, be it an addiction, pride, malice, fleshly passions, poverty, sickness or failure; by the reason of the Word today, these are all defeated. The Lord says, “You shall never encounter such in life again. Your liberty has been written today... Be still!”</p>
		  	<p>The limitations are broken! Whatsoever has been a limitation to your Ministry, health, service, amongst others, is defeated today. The Lord is releasing you to live beyond limits! Personalize this Word... Make a Rhema out of it today... The Egyptians are dead, and buried. No more shall we see them again! Amen!</p>
