		  	<p><i>A sound heart is the life of the flesh: but envy the rottenness of the bones. (Proverbs 14:30)</i></p>
		  	

		  	<blockquote>An envious and jealous heart results in a leprous body; wrath makes the bones rot;</blockquote>

		  	<p>There is nothing that brings rot to the bones faster than envy; it is the deadliest cancer. Envy is a selfish desire to possess what someone else has; from it, hatred is birthed.</p>
		  	<p>Some people would go to any length to plot the downfall of another man; in a bid to make themselves more successful, they’d attempt to make someone else a failure. What they often fail to realize is that no man needs to fall in order for them to rise.</p>
		  	<p>The progress of another man does not mean that you are backward. Why envy? When a man begins to envy his heart becomes heavy with grudges, bitterness, hatred and wrath. As a result, his bones begin to rot.</p>
		  	<p>Let’s take a good look at Miriam; she was doing just great. At the time when Pharaoh’s daughter found Moses, she was the one who called his mother to be a nurse to him. She was a loving sister indeed.</p>
		  	<p>However, as time went on, when Moses was all grown and the Lord began to use him mightily in leading the Israelites, Miriam became envious and jealous of him. This led her to speak evil of him with Aaron; leprosy was the result of her jealousy.</p>
		  	<p>An envious and jealous heart results in a leprous body; wrath makes the bones rot; hatred is like cancer to the body. Just like Miriam, a single act of jealousy can yield leprosy and rotting of the bones.</p>
		  	<p>Envy is such a plague; the feeling of wanting the downfall of another, in order for you to step up, can never be from God.</p>
		  	<p>Paul wrote a letter to the newly established church in Corinth to confront and correct them. He knew the implications of envy and strife, thus he couldn’t let the church persist in such. Here’s an excerpt of Paul’s letter to the Church in Corinth.</p>
		  	<p><i>For ye are yet carnal: for whereas there is among you envying, and strife, and divisions, are ye not carnal, and walk as men? (1 Corinthians 3:3)</i></p>
		  	<p>Envy is an act of carnality. Where there is envy, division must persist; and a body divided against itself cannot stand. It is obvious that envy is the cause of instability in a lot of organizations and bodies.</p>
		  	<p>When everyone wants to gain a good name, reputation and stand at the expense of others, there can’t be progress.</p>
		  	<p>In our reading today, it is proven that envy results in rottenness of the bones; some versions of this same scripture likens envy to cancer. Cancer is a disease that spreads so fast through the body, until it has sapped out every substance of life.</p>
		  	<p>Envy is the deadliest cancer; a little envy in a part of the body can result in the downfall of the entire body.</p>
		  	<p>No one needs to die for you to live longer; no one needs to fall for you to rise; no one needs to fail for you to succeed; no one needs to be sacked for you to be promoted. Quit envy, evil conspiracies and plot. Promotion is of the Lord. Be blessed!</p>
