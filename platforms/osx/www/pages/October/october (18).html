		  	<p><i>Who his own self bare our sins in his own body on the tree, that we, being dead to sins, should live unto righteousness: by whose stripes ye were healed. (1 Peter 2:24)</i></p>

		  	<blockquote>When knowledge comes, faith sets in, and sickness becomes past-tense.</blockquote>

		  	<p>I have come across a lot of people who endlessly pray for healing; some ignorantly plead with sickness to leave them alone. Only a few actually regard good health as their birth right.</p>
		  	<p>I have seen the crippled attend crusades, and walk out in good health, without any wheel chair or crutches. In the same way, several other infirmities have been cast out by the Power of God.</p>
		  	<p>However, what we must understand is that those fellows did not get healed at those crusades; they only received the healing (which has since been made available) there.</p>
		  	<p>Faith puts ill situations in the past; notice the use of the term, ye were healed. This implies that our healing is past tense. It is never quoted, “ . . . we will be healed” no! We have already been healed. The moment Jesus took the stripes, healing was made available; the moment we receive it in faith, it is physically manifested. It is written:</p>
		  	<p><i>Christ hath redeemed us from the curse of the law, being made a curse for us: for it is written, Cursed is every one that hangeth on a tree: (Galatians 3:13)</i></p>
		  	<p>Again this scripture portrays our redemption from the curse of law in a past tense. It is not quoted, “we will be redeemed from the curse of the law,” but that we have been redeemed. The use of the term redeemed reflects a lot.</p>
		  	<p>To start with, sickness is part of that curse of the law; if really we have been redeemed from the curse, we can easily conclude that we have already been made free from the grip of any sickness or infirmity.</p>
		  	<p>The death and resurrection of Jesus has granted us all that we ever need; being born again entails the death of the human nature, and the birth of a new spirit man. This new man is healed and redeemed already!</p>
		  	<p>Therefore, it is highly erroneous for a born-again man to demote himself to the extent of pleading for healing or redemption. As a matter of truth, that can only be as a result of ignorance to the Word of God.</p>
		  	<p>There is no point asking for healing when it has already been given to you; all you need to do is to receive it in faith. You are redeemed and healed already!</p>
		  	<p>The truth is, a born-again man, who is still lying on his sick bed, has already been healed, but is not aware of it. When knowledge comes, faith sets in and sickness becomes past-tense.</p>
		  	<p>When you decide to give up ignorance by constantly meditating on the Word of God, faith comes in. At this juncture nothing remains impossible. Rejoice, you are healed and redeemed already!</p>
