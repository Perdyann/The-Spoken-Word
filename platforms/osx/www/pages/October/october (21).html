		  	<p><i>Ye are of God, little children, and have overcome them: because greater is he that is in you, than he that is in the world. (1 John 4:4)</i></p>
		
		  	<blockquote>Our victory is not lingering in the future; we are victorious already. </blockquote>

		  	<p>Did you notice that this scripture does not give an assurance that we will overcome someday; rather, our victorious status is clearly portrayed. We have overcome already.</p>
		  	<p>When I first read this scripture, I capitalized on the last sentence much more than I capitalized on the first. I was too quick to be excited over the fact that the greater one is in me.</p>
		  	<p>Thus, I began to make a confession that <i> since the greater one is in me, I will surely overcome.</i> It took me further meditation on all the lines to realize that I have overcome already.</p>
		  	<p>Our victory is not lingering in the future; no! It was with us, and is still with us. We are victorious already.</p>
		  	<p>I always thought that David defeated Goliath in the battle field — I was wrong! Goliath was defeated long ago. What David did was just a physical manifestation of the victory that had since been attained.</p>
		  	<p>At the war-front, it did not matter what David would have done to him; he was already a dead man. At that point, there was no need for any weapon or ammunition; just a slap would have brought him down.</p>
		  	<p>One thing I admire about David is his confidence; he was so sure that he had overcome already, and soon, he got the world to believe that too. Likewise beloved, be confident in the truth that you have overcome already.</p>
		  	<p>Quit praying that God should help you to overcome. David never did that. He was certain that he had overcome already. God will not help you to overcome; He has already done all the He will do. You just need to be confident in your victory; have faith!</p>
		  	<p>The truth is, as Christians, most of the battles we are confronted with are won already. We overcame these battles when Jesus died and rose again!</p>
		  	<p>When Jesus overcame death by His glorious resurrection, we also obtained victory over every ill situation. You have got the victory to that battle already.</p>
		  	<p>The only edge the enemy can have over a Christian is ignorance; if you have overcome a battle without knowing it, you will never be able to assume the position of a champ.</p>
		  	<p>Be confident in the truth that you have already overcome all of life’s’ battles. Stop worrying over the victory, it is certainly yours’. Be blessed!</p>
