		  	<i style="text-align:justify">Then he said, Go around and borrow vessels from all your neighbors, empty vessels—and not a few.<br/>And when you come in, shut the door upon you and your sons. Then pour out [the oil you have] into all those vessels, setting aside each one when it is full.<br/>So she went from him and shut the door upon herself and her sons, who brought to her the vessels as she poured the oil. <br/>When the vessels were all full, she said to her son, Bring me another vessel. And he said to her, There is not a one left. Then the oil stopped multiplying. (2 Kings 4:3-6)</i>
		  	<blockquote style="text-align:justify">Stop chasing opportunities! Start building your capacity. For even when the opportunity meets you incapacitated, it becomes void.</blockquote>

		  	<p style="text-align:justify">Why did Elisha command the widow to prepare vessels before she starts to pour? God is not ready to release oil to vessels that are not prepared to contain. In order to have a supernatural flow of oil, and income in your life, you’ve got to be a prepared and ready vessel. The secret to the multiplication of oil rested in the mystery of preparation.</p>
		  	<p style="text-align:justify">It is the vessels that made the oil to flow! Notice that the moment the vessels were finished, the oil stopped multiplying (vs. 6). As long as there were containers, the contents never seized to flow.</p>
		  	<p style="text-align:justify">Take a glimpse at the miracle Jesus performed—turning water to wine. Before He commanded the water to become wine, he needed to make water available. The preparation of water was necessary in order to have wine. When you need a breakthrough, start by preparing for it.</p>
		  	<p style="text-align:justify">The Israelites embarked on a journey to the Promise land. This was a journey that was scheduled to take a maximum of forty days, but it ended up taking forty years. And I asked why? The truth is; it did not take God forty years to fulfill a forty days promise. It took the Israelites forty years to get prepared.</p>
		  	<p style="text-align:justify">When forty days came, it met them unprepared! They were still complaining at day forty; they were still entangled with idols at day forty. They were focused on their past (Egypt), and not the promise land, as at the fortieth day. As a result, the time was postponed, and the promise land delayed.</p>
		  	<p style="text-align:justify">Lack of preparation is the major cause of delay. It delays blessings! When a break-through meets you unprepared, the time of manifestation is postponed. It awaits your readiness.</p>
		  	<p style="text-align:justify">Today, bear in mind that the time has come for the fulfillment of the Word of God over your life, but the manifestation is dependent on your level of preparation. What was meant when it was written,</p>
		  	<p style="text-align:justify"><i>“For even though by this time you ought to be teaching others, you actually need someone to teach you over again the very first principles of God’s Word. You have come to need milk, not solid food.” (Hebrews 5:12)?</i></p>
		  	<p style="text-align:justify">t means that originally, God’s appointed time for you to assume that position has come, but you cannot access it the way you are. You’ve got to be prepared and ready for it. When the time for a child to begin eating solid food reaches (let’s say 1 year), and he is still not developed yet, he keeps feeding on milk. Before you can step up to your next level of glory, you’ve got to be prepared to handle it.</p>
		  	<p style="text-align:justify">The best equipment you could give yourself in any season of expectation is preparation. Most times, people trust God for certain things that they are not prepared for. God in His loving mercy, seeing fully well that they are not prepared to handle what He wants to release, will calmly withhold it. When you release something to someone when they are premature, it could be more of a curse to them than it is a blessing.</p>
		  	<p style="text-align:justify">A son who has pleased his father so much may actually deserve everything the father owns including his car, but is really not due to receive it, because at the age of 14, driving a car, no matter how exotic it may be, might result in more disaster that luck.</p>
		  	<p style="text-align:justify">In most cases, after people have trusted God for something, and have not received it yet, they develop a wrong perception of the Word. So often, they are consoled by words like, “don’t worry, it’s not yet your time.” God made me to understand that in most cases the time has come, but the people are not yet prepared for the season, and so it tarries.</p>
		  	<p style="text-align:justify">The bible declares that an heir as long as he is a child is no different from a slave, until his appointed time. Never assume God’s appointed time for you to be a particular day of the month. No! The appointed time is the time when you are proven fit to assume the office. It is when God has seen your level of preparation.</p>
		  	<p style="text-align:justify">Many people are seeking offices, and appointments that they are really not prepared to handle. Stop chasing opportunities! Start building your capacity. For even when the opportunity meets you incapacitated, it becomes void. You can only take advantage of that which you were preparedly awaiting. Today, deliberately prepare yourself for the future. Get ready to handle what God has promised to release.</p>
