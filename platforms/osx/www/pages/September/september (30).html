		  	<p><i>For verily I say unto you, That many prophets and righteous men have desired to see those things which ye see, and have not seen them; and to hear those things which ye hear, and have not heard them.</i></p>
		  

		  	<blockquote>To whom much is given, much is expected; don’t sit down in your comfort zone, doing nothing, when you have been given everything. </blockquote>

		  	<p>Beloved, the Prophets of old did not have what we have now; the people of old never had the opportunities we have now. So much has been given to us through Christ, in His death and resurrection.</p>
		  	<p>The Holy Spirit dwelt not in any man until Jesus had resurrected; thus the Prophets of old never had the Holy Spirit dwelling in them. He came upon the appointed occasionally, and departed.</p>
		  	<p>In the time of Moses, he often encountered the presence of God on the mountains, when he was overshadowed by a cloud, and the Lord spoke. In essence, he was not opportune to have that presence just anytime.</p>
		  	<p>Also, the people never had direct access to God; they had to go through His Prophets. But the death and resurrection of Jesus changed the situation; it made available graces that never existed</p>
		  	<p>However, I keep wondering: if the Prophets of old, who encountered the presence of God occasionally, could do such great things, as were done of them in the past, how much more can we do, when we have got the Holy Spirit resident in us every second?</p>
		  	<p>Beloved, the access the people of old had to the presence of God, was very limited, in as it was indirect; but by the resurrection of Christ, we now have direct access to His presence anytime, and anywhere.</p>
		  	<p>You can sit down in your bedroom and pray directly to God; you can be in your house, and be in the presence of God. This was not the case before; indeed, many Prophets and righteous men of old longed to see what we now see.</p>
		  	<p>We no longer need to go through any priest to have our sins forgiven; there is unlimited access to the throne of grace, for you to boldly — without shame or condemnation — approach it anytime, and obtain mercy.</p>
		  	<p>This is what the people of old desired, but never received. We have grace, unrestricted access to His presence, and unlimited supply of His mercy. This is not our excuse to abide in sin, but our rescue from the sinful life.</p>
		  	<p>Beloved, to whom much is given, much is expected; don’t sit down in your comfort zone, doing nothing, when you have been given everything.</p>
		  	<p>Let every action you take in life, be prompted by the consciousness of what you have within you; you have too much to live an ordinary life. You have what others never had; you should fulfil much more than they ever did. Be blessed!</p>
