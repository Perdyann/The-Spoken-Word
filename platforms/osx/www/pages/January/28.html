		  <div class="panel-body" style="text-align:justify">

		  	<p><i>But the people that do know their God shall be strong, and do exploits. (Daniel 11:32b)</i></p>
		  	

		  	<blockquote>Your strength and exploits in its maximized capacity, lies in that bosom of your Knowledge of God.</blockquote>

		  	<p>The question is—Do you really know the God whom you serve? Strength is not meant for everyone, it is for those that know their God. Exploit is not meant for the ordinary... it is not an ordinary word... it is meant for they that know their God.</p>
		  	<p>Except you know your God, you’d never get to that place of complete strength. Seldom shall you see exploits when you don’t know God.</p>
		  	<p>What is your reaction to challenges? People who know the capacity and ability of their God remain calm in challenging situations... they don’t need to struggle that much. They produce sweatless results.</p>
		  	<p>It is only people who really don’t know their God that panic. It is only people who limit and doubt the ability of their God that fret. Such people are subject to natural rules and worldly principles because they are aliens to God’s realm of Life. The best they could ever produce is “average”. However, exploits are extraordinary and uncommon results which are only manifested by those who know their God.</p>
		  	<p>Have you ever thought to yourself why Shedrach, Meshach and Abednego refused to bow down to the idols even when their life was threatened? They were so convinced that the God whom they serve was capable of saving them. They knew and trusted the ability, strength and pre-eminence of God.</p>
		  	<p>And to think of David... I must say, it was not the cheer from the crowd that gave him courage, but the knowledge of his God. He was so confident in the might and Power of God, that he had the courage to start the murder of Goliath by braggadocios confessions.</p>
		  	<p>People must have wondered if the little boy was out of his senses. There’s more to it... He was speaking not of his human reasoning, but based on his knowledge of God.</p>
		  	<p>All your life, you might have been seeking nothing but the expression of your strength. You may have been struggling to do something that would at least be appreciated. You’ve aimed for these exploits for so long. Tonight, I’m here to tell you, your strength and exploits in its maximized capacity, lies in that bosom of your Knowledge of God. Be blessed!</p>
