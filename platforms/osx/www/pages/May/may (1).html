		  	<p><i>But the Lord said unto Samuel, Look not on his countenance, or on the height of his stature; because I have refused him: for the Lord seeth not as man seeth; for man looketh on the outward appearance, but the Lord looketh on the heart. (1 Samuel 16:7)</i></p>


		  	<blockquote>The real book is not the cover, but the content. The cover of the book might get you attracted to it, but the content will keep it longer in your hands.</blockquote>

		  	<p>When Samuel sighted Eliab, he was convinced beyond reasonable doubts, that he was the rightful King to be anointed. Eliab was like a book with such an attractive cover, that Samuel never bothered to read its content.</p>
		  	<p>He had an attractive countenance, height, and built stature; those are the exact qualities an earthly man will look out for. Samuel was carried away by his cover page that he didn’t care to flip over and view the inner pages. That’s the exact way men look at things, but definitely not God’s perspective.</p>
		  	<p>In God’s perspective, the content should be analyzed and approved, before the beauty of the cover can be celebrated. The world will be a better place if we can decide to look beyond the covers of everyone. If we can look beyond the structure of people and appreciate their potentials, the world will be faced with the best boom ever.</p>
		  	<p>Here’s what God’s perspective is like:
			God looks beyond your mess and sees a message;
			He looks beyond your mistakes, and releases a miracle; He looks beyond your present, and sees your future; He looks beyond your structure, and sees your potentials;</p>
		  	<p>Men are quick to celebrate your weaknesses and flaws, but God never ceases to strengthen and perfect us.</p>
		  	<p>Learn to see things from God’s perspective, and not that of men. Men are quick to judge the cover; but God views, renews and replenishes the content. Rather than being critical to the covers of people, learn to invest in their content.</p>
		  	<p>The real book is not the cover, but the content. The cover of the book might get you attracted to it, but the content will keep it longer in your hands. Much more than I want people to merely explore me, I want them to learn from me, and appreciate me.</p>
		  	<p>Beloved, looking at the present state of your spouse or family, you might be filled with regrets; you might wish you had gotten something better; but if only you could look beyond the covers, and value the content, something greater than transformation will occur. Look beyond the present state of your job, family, education, and affairs; rather, be focused on God’s promises.</p>
		  	<p>Like the Israelites, you might be in a dry, boring and tiring wilderness, but if you can look beyond the wilderness, and see the promise land, you will receive strength to get there in good time.</p>
		  	<p>Quit being critical towards people; Quit wishing you had something better than what you have; View life from God’s perspective . . . Look beyond the cover, and value the content. Be blessed!</p>
