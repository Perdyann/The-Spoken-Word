		  <div class="panel-body" style="text-align:justify">


		  	<p><i>Seest thou a man diligent in his business? he shall stand before kings; he shall not stand before mean men. (Proverbs 22:29)</i></p>


		  	<blockquote>There are men who are merely regarded as ordinary people, whereas, some others have broken off the limitation of mediocrity, and chosen to stand in the path of leaders.</blockquote>

		  	<p>We have heard people say, “All fingers are not equal.” Some people consider this statement very offensive, while some others usually use it to illustrate difference.</p>
		  	<p>I’ve realised that majority of those, who consider this statement offensive, are short-fingered people, because they are the ones it actually hurts. But will you really blame others, who make frequent use of this statement? I don’t think so.</p>
		  	<p>Although it is quite discriminatory, it is more of a reality. So often the bible differentiates between the conditions of kings, royals, great men, and that of mere, mediocre and ordinary men.</p>
		  	<p>This particular passage throws light to the truth that diligent men stand before Kings, and not ordinary men. Verily, there are men who are merely regarded as ordinary people, whereas, some others have broken off the limitation of mediocrity, and chosen to stand in the path of leaders.</p>
		  	<p>What is the secret to being distinguished as King, from the crowd of many ordinary men? What is the key to being set apart for greatness, amidst a multitude of average men? Diligence!</p>
		  	<p>Beloved, the Word of God is the truth, and it is reliable. If it has given us the assurance that diligence pays, then it is true.</p>
		  	<p>Diligence is carefully persisting in every good work, with all attentiveness and effort, ensuring that quality is constantly on the rise.</p>
		  	<p>How persistent are you? Do you start up projects, go half way, and quit? Are you in love with procrastination? Do you invest effort to ensure accuracy, or you really don’t care about quality?</p>
		  	<p>Greatness and mediocrity is laid before you today, you are the one, who defines what category to stand in life . . . It is written:</p>
		  	<p><i>He becometh poor that dealeth with a slack hand: but the hand of the diligent maketh rich. (Proverbs 10:4)</i></p>
		  	<p>Verily, the hand of the diligent maketh rich. Abraham staggered not at the promise of God through unbelief. (Romans 4:20). Beloved, don’t stagger. Whatsoever is worth doing is worth doing well—Philip Stanhope.</p>
		  	<p>If at all that project is worth working on, let it be handled diligently; if at all the work of God is worth your time, do it diligently.</p>
		  	<p>Verily, there is a Divine purpose for our lives. We will one day stand to give account of what we have done in our entire life-time. God has deposited great potentials and gifts in every man; we are to diligently maximize God’s deposit in our lives daily.</p>
		  	<p>Be diligent, don’t stagger, don’t procrastinate and never give up. Go back to that forsaken mandate and assignment, and handle it diligently this time. Your standing is with Kings and not mean (average) men. Be blessed!</p>
