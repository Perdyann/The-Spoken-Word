		  <div class="panel-body" style="text-align:justify">


		  	<p><i>For I say, through the grace given unto me, to every man that is among you, not to think of himself more highly than he ought to think; but to think soberly, according as God hath dealt to every man the measure of faith.</i></p>
		  	<p><i>Be of the same mind one toward another. Mind not high things, but condescend to men of low estate. Be not wise in your own conceits. (Romans 3:3 & 16)</i></p>


		  	<blockquote>It is good to be confident of our great stand in God, but in some cases, what is deemed confidence, is merely deceit.</blockquote>

		  	<p>Self deceit is one of the worst things that could ever lay hold of any man. Being deceived by other people still leaves you with an opportunity to discover the real situation; however, being deceived by yourself, hinders every possibility of discovering the truth.</p>
		  	<p>It is better to think of yourself in all humility, and eventually discover that you are better than you thought; than for you to think of yourself more highly than you ought to, and eventually, be brought lower than your thoughts.</p>
		  	<p>Some men glorify themselves. From their own perspective, they are doing absolutely great, they are pleasing God, and they are very reputable. However, God views them from a different perspective.</p>
		  	<p>If there is one prayer I constantly make to God in every season, it is, “Lord, help me to see myself the way you see me.” My desire always is to know what I look like in the eyes of God.</p>
		  	<p>Beloved, it is not the way you see yourself that matters, it is not the way men regard you that matters. What matters most is how God sees you. Little wonder the scripture today admonishes us not to be wise in our own conceits or from our own view, but from God’s perspective. Proverbs 3:7 states exactly the same thing.</p>
		  	<p>Many are languishing in self deceit. They think they are serving God, but God says they are serving themselves, and their senses.</p>
		  	<p>When God spoke to the church of the Laodiceans, He mentioned;</p>
		  	<p><i>Because thou sayest, I am rich, and increased with goods, and have need of nothing; and knowest not that thou art wretched, and miserable, and poor, and blind, and naked: (Revelation 3:17)</i></p>
		  	<p>How do you define a situation whereby people think they are rich, increasing, and needless, whereas God sees them as being wretched, miserable, poor, blind and naked? This is nothing but self deceit.</p>
		  	<p>Self deceit is harmful because it blinds the eyes of the wretched congregation, to discovering that they are in need. This is a congregation that feels satisfied and content with its present situation, but unknown to it, it’s in a mess.</p>
		  	<p>It is good to be confident of our great stand in God, but in some cases, what is deemed confidence, is merely deceit.</p>
		  	<p>Notice that the message in the book of Revelation, chapter 3, is not directed to just anyone, but to the church;</p>
		  	<p>Verily, there are people in church who started up in Christ, but derailed. Such people may still think they are serving God, but God sees them differently. There are churches that started up preaching the Gospel of the Kingdom, but eventually derailed to their own messages, in order to retain their members. How long will you continue languishing in self deceit?</p>
		  	<p>Many glorify themselves, in the name of glorifying God. “Stop deceiving yourself; Return to me, and I will return to you,” says the LORD.</p>
		  	<p>It is my prayer that God will open your eyes to areas of your life, which may seem good enough to you, but looks miserable from God’s perspective. Be blessed!</p>
