		  	<p><i>But made himself of no reputation, and took upon him the form of a servant, and was made in the likeness of men:</i></p>
		  	<p><i>And being found in fashion as a man, he humbled himself, and became obedient unto death, even the death of the cross. (Philippians 2:7-8)</i></p>
		  	
		  	<blockquote>A reputation that will not endure till the end is not worth having.</blockquote>

		  	<p>In the table of priorities, love comes before reputation, profile and class. Never value your reputation and profile at the expense of love.</p>
		  	<p>In verse five of this same chapter of the bible, we are admonished to have the same mind, as was in Christ Jesus. Paul went further to elaborate what kind of mind Jesus had, and then released these scripture verses.</p>
		  	<p>What I can perceive is that His mind was filled with so much love, which yielded humility. Such love, which He held higher than His reputation.</p>
		  	<p>Even though He was the only begotten Son of God, He made himself of no reputation. In essence, he casted down his reputation, and took the form of a servant. To think of it, how many reputable men of this age will drop their reputation for anything?</p>
		  	<p>To prove the value of love over reputation, Jesus gave up His reputation, became a servant in the likeness of men. He was humble and obedient even unto the death of the cross—such death, which was considered a curse.</p>
		  	<p>It is often said—it was not the nails that kept Jesus on the cross, it was love. Verily, Jesus did not give up his reputation for anything else, but love.</p>
		  	<p>One of the reasons why the rich man might have failed to respond to the needs of Lazarus was probably because he valued his profile and reputation much more than love. He might not have wanted to stain his reputation by mingling with such a low-class individual. Where did his reputation lead him? Hell!</p>
		  	<p>Unlike the rich man, Jesus is exalted, and given a name, which is above every other name. A name, that brings to subjection all elemental spirits of the world.</p>
		  	<p>The reputation and profiles we build on earth lasts only for a lifetime; but love is a higher reputation that endures forever. Don’t stick to the temporal reputation; go for that which is everlasting.</p>
		  	<p>Much more than I want to be reputable on earth, I want to be exalted at last. The end matters even more than the beginning. A reputation that will not endure till the end is not worth having. Be blessed!</p>
