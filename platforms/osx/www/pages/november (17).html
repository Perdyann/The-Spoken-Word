		  	<p><i>And the Lord said, Simon, Simon, behold, Satan hath desired to have you, that he may sift you as wheat:</i></p>
		  	<p><i><b>But I have prayed for thee, that thy faith fail not:</b> and when thou art converted, strengthen thy brethren. (Luke 22:31-32)</i></p>
		

		  	<blockquote>Faith is as essential in our walk in God, as the heart is essential for the body to live.</blockquote>

		  	<p>Faith in God is like the heart in the body; when the heart seizes to beat, a body dies. Likewise, when a man seizes to operate in faith, life is sapped out of his spirit.</p>
		  	<p>We hear of people, who died as a result of heart failure; in the same way, many have died as a result of faith failure. Faith is as essential in our walk in God, as the heart is essential for the body to live.</p>
		  	<p>Of all things Jesus could pray for, concerning his disciple (Peter), it was that his faith should not fail. He prayed in that manner because He understood the importance of faith. He knew that Peter would be a failure if his faith failed, likewise, it is impossible for him to fail, when his faith is active. Thus, faith is obviously the base-line.</p>
		  	<p>Jesus prayer was not that Simon should not deny Him, neither was it that he should resist temptation. His entire prayer was summarized in faith! As long as the heart fails not, the body remains alive; likewise, as long as faith fails not, victory is certain.</p>
		  	<p>I have seen people, who survived gun-shots because the bullets narrowly escaped the heart; if the heart was affected, the whole body would have been dead. If faith gets affected, the Christian-life is non-profitable.</p>
		  	<p>I have seen people, who survived great burns in flames of fire because it never got to the heart; they would have been dead if the heart was affected. Trials can fade away your outer nature, but never let anything weaken your faith.</p>
		  	<p>When the Doctor wants to check the consciousness of any patient, he begins to study the heart-beat. The heart-beat is the sign that the patient is still alive. Likewise our faith-beat is the sign that we are living the Higher Life.</p>
		  	<p>The toughness of your trial cannot determine how successful you will be; the strength of your faith does. Faith is like the heart to the body — our victory lies in faith.</p>
		  	<p>Is your heart still beating? If it is not, then you are dead. Is your faith still beating (active)? If it is not, then you are not alive.</p>
		  	<p>Without faith, it is impossible to please God; without faith, victory can never be attained; without faith, the Christian life is void; faith is like the heart — it keeps the body alive.</p>
		  	<p>If you are still struggling with financial, economic, immigration, or academic trials and challenges; then you need to check your faith-beat. When you get your faith active, nothing remains impossible. Be blessed!</p>
