		  <div class="panel-body" style="text-align:justify">


		  	<p><i>The end of the world is near. You must be the boss over your mind. Keep awake so you can pray. (1 Peter 4:7 NLV)</i></p>

		  	<blockquote>Whatsoever you want to be or achieve in life, is solely dependent on how you think. A man is his thoughts!</blockquote>

		  	<p>We are admonished to be the boss of our mind! In comprehending the meaning of the scripture, we must be able to understand what it means to be a boss.</p>
		  	<p>A boss is in charge! He manages, conducts, and organizes every affair. Nothing gets in or out of place, without his knowledge; he guards jealously his own.</p>
		  	<p>In being the boss of our mind, we ought to be in charge of the inflow and outflow of information. We should be discerning enough to know what information to keep or discard.</p>
		  	<p>Our mind is informed by our senses of audibility and vision, and it is expressed in our speech. It matters a lot what we hear and see. We never speak faster than our minds! Verily, even a slip of the tongue was thought of</p>
		  	<p>We shouldn’t hearken to everything. Yielding to wrong information, could result in pollution. It is very good to be in the midst of counselors, but it important to know who you are receiving counsel from. Yielding to bad counsel and advice kills faster than the venom of a deadly viper. What then should we hear? Words of edification, birthed from God’s Word!</p>
		  	<p>Job said, <i>I made a covenant with mine eyes; why then should I think upon a maid? (Job 31:1)</i></p>
		  	<p>Beloved, be careful what you expose your eyes to; the pictures we see, are stored in the mind. Job never wanted to think lustfully on a maid, all he did was to make a covenant with his eyes. Verily, if the eyes could be free, our minds can be free.</p>
		  	<p>Exposing your eyes to pornographic materials only makes you a dirty chunk. It fills your mind with all negative pictures, which births wrong and regrettable actions. You are what you see! When your vision is right, your mind is right, and you speak right, there is no limit to the heights you can attain.</p>
		  	<p>Verily, there is no better way to guard your mind, than guarding your eyes and ears. Restrict your senses to receiving and accepting God’s Word alone. It is written:</p>
		  	<p><i>Keep and guard your heart with all vigilance and above all that you guard, for out of it flow the springs of life. (Proverbs 4:23)</i></p>
		  	<p>Above all that you could ever guard, guard your mind! How powerful! Out of the heart flows springs of life. Some versions state, <i> “Your thinking controls your life.”</i></p>
		  	<p>Whatsoever you want to be or achieve in life, is solely dependent on how you think. A man is his thoughts! (Proverbs 23:7) Be the boss of your mind!</p>
