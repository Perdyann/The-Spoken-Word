		  	<p><i>For whatsoever is born of God overcometh the world: and this is the victory that overcometh the world, even our faith. (1 John 5:4)</i></p>
		  	

		  	<blockquote>The magnitude of your faith determines the extent of your victory.</blockquote>

		  	<p>There is something interesting about this scripture; firstly, we are given an assurance that whatsoever is born of God overcometh the world. Just as we begin to rejoice over that, the victory is pronounced.</p>
		  	<p>It states, <i>“ ... this is the victory that overcometh the world, even our faith.” </i> Did you notice that faith is never described as ‘a victory’ that overcomes, but ‘the victory’ that overcomes?</p>
		  	<p>If faith was indeed a victory that overcame the world, we would easily assume that there are other victories; but by the use of the term ‘the victory’, there is no room for assumptions. Faith is the only victory that overcomes; nothing more, nothing less!</p>
		  	<p>Just the same way the scripture states that Jesus is the way, and not a way, because He is the only way; faith is the victory and not a victory, because it is the only victory. Faith is the victory that overcomes the world—without faith, the world can never be overcome.</p>
		  	<p>Now, let us go back to the first part of that scripture: if indeed faith is the only victory that overcometh the world, why then are we assured that whatsoever is born of God overcomes?</p>
		  	<p>Verily, whatsoever is born of God has faith already! The only issue is that there are different measures of faith, and we are expected to grow in faith. What a giant faith can do, a grain faith cannot do.</p>
		  	<p>When Jesus told His disciples that a mustard-seed faith can move mountains, He was not referring to the initial size of the mustard seed, but the growing ability of the seed. In essence, a growing faith, and not a small faith is what causes great exploits.</p>
		  	<p>People with growing and developed faith can move mountains, but those, who are stagnant in faith, can barely shift stones.</p>
		  	<p>I have seen born-again men suffer like ordinary men; I have seen tongue-talking believers languish in pain like mere children of poverty stricken men. Why? They are probably stagnant in faith.</p>
		  	<p>Even though by virtue of our new-birth, we should be victorious; this cannot be the case, when faith is not put to work. Verily, the magnitude of your faith is what determines the extent of your victory.</p>
		  	<p>Beloved, faith is the victory that overcomes; you might be born again, but as long as you walk in fear, and not faith, then you cannot be victorious.</p>
		  	<p>It is good to know that we have overcome already, and we are victorious already; but it is greater to know that all that we are in Christ is only activated by faith. Faith is the victory that overcomes — Be blessed!</p>
