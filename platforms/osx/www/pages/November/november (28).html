		  	<p><i>Don’t team up with those who are unbelievers. How can righteousness be a partner with wickedness? How can light live with darkness? (2 Corinthians 6:14)</i></p>

		  	<blockquote>If your destination is not the same as mine, there’s no point journeying together with you</blockquote>

		  	<p>As most versions quote, “Do not be unequally yoked with unbelievers” So often, I have been asked questions regarding the meaning of this scripture, and what aspects of life it could be related to.</p>
		  	<p>People want to know if they can be married to those with different beliefs; others want to know who can qualify to join their business teams; some are in need of partners in projects, and are wondering if this scripture applies to them.</p>
		  	<p>To a large extent, this depends on the goals you want to achieve; for instance, in order to know if you can get married to an unbeliever, you need to find out the purpose of your marriage. Are you getting married for the fun of it, or with an intention of raising a family in the way of the Lord?</p>
		  	<p>I believe that there is a reason why Paul admonished us not to be unequally yoked with unbelievers.</p>
		  	<p>I don’t understand how two parties with different beliefs can achieve the same goal. Just like light and darkness cannot share a room, people of different beliefs cannot journey on the same route.</p>
		  	<p>Do not team up with unbelievers; do not journey with people, who are headed for a different destination!</p>
		  	<p>Jonah was supposed to be going to Nineveh, but he got on a boat, with people, who were headed to Tarshish. Let’s also view it from the other perspective—the sail men were headed to Tarshish, but teamed up with someone whose destination was Nineveh.</p>
		  	<p>This resulted in loss to one party, and discomfort to the other. The sail men lost their valuables, and Jonah had to spend three nights in the belly of the fish. Spare yourself the loss, by teaming up with the right people.</p>
		  	<p>If your destination is not the same as mine, there’s no point journeying together with you; that might be very consequential! What partnership has righteousness with wickedness?</p>
		  	<p>Are you planning on getting married soon? Are you looking to raise a team or partners for your Divine project? Team up with people of like mindset and beliefs. Team up with people of same vision and goals as you have.</p>
		  	<p>The only reason why Joseph and his brothers couldn’t get along so well was that they had different visions; they didn’t have the capacity to contain Joseph’s visions.</p>
		  	<p>Don’t force yourself to relate and journey with people, whose destination is different from yours’. Let your vision, goals and destiny select and define your company. Be blessed!</p>
