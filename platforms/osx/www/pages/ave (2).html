		  	<p><i>And I will bless her, and give thee a son also of her: yea, I will bless her, and she shall be a mother of nations; kings of people shall be of her.</i></p>
		  	<p><i>Then Abraham fell upon his face, and laughed, and said in his heart, Shall a child be born unto him that is an hundred years old? and shall Sarah, that is ninety years old, bear?</i></p>
		  	<p><i>And Abraham said unto God, O that Ishmael might live before thee! (Genesis 17:16-18)</i></p>


		  	<blockquote>Rather than presenting God with humanly possible options to choose from, stick to the Divine plan of God; He knows how to make a possibility of all impossibilities.</blockquote>

		  	<p>Sometimes, trusting God is not as easy as it seems. It is quite easy to trust God for things that are humanly possible, but more tasking to trust God, even in situations that have never been possible.</p>
		  	<p>It wasn’t so difficult for Abraham to trust God and journey to an unknown land; initially, it wasn’t so difficult for Abraham to trust God’s ability to make him the father of all nations; but as time went on, he found it infeasible to trust God for a child with Sarah.</p>
		  	<p>Throughout the entire 100 years Abraham had lived, he had never seen a child born to anyone of his present age, neither had he seen any 90 years old pregnant woman. Amidst such a situation, it was difficult for him to put himself in a position of trust. Hence, he had given up on the chances of him bearing a son with Sarah.</p>
		  	<p>Prior to that time, when God had promised to make him the Father of all nations, he chose to trust. Hagar conceived and bore him a son, Ishmael. I presume, when Ishmael was born, Abraham must have said, “this is just it!”</p>
		  	<p>The chapter of him having a child with Sarah must have been closed by the birth of Ishmael. That is why when God still spoke to Abraham about having a child with Sarah, he suggested that God should make the promise to come through Ishmael.</p>
		  	<p>Abraham had weighed all possibilities and figured out that it is only through Ishmael that the promise can be made manifest.</p>
		  	<p>Beloved, do not tag God for a certain means of fulfilling His Word; do not give God possible options. When God gives you a promise or Word, don’t try to figure it out.</p>
		  	<p>From the corresponding statement of Abraham, <i> “O that Ishmael might live before thee!” </i> It is obvious that he had figured things out, and related the promise to Ishmael. Meanwhile, God had other plans.</p>
		  	<p>This really taught Abraham to trust God, even for impossibilities. His further actions of faith proved it.</p>
		  	<p>Just like Abraham, God might have given us a Word in a certain season. No matter how impossible the fulfillment of that Word may seem, don’t try to figure it out, and present God with your options.</p>
		  	<p>The only chance you may have of getting your bills sorted, might be through someone, whom you already have in mind. Thus, when you pray, you are praying for God to touch the person’s heart to help you. This ought not to be so. Let God be the only means you have; don’t be concerned about how, just trust Him.</p>
		  	<p>God knows the thoughts of a man’s heart; it is written:</p>
		  	<p><i>Many are the plans in a person’s heart, but it is the Lord’s purpose that prevails. (Proverbs 19:21)</i></p>
		  	<p>Beloved, let us trust God with all our hearts, at no point should we begin to lean on our own understanding. (Proverbs 3:5). Rather than presenting God with humanly possible options to choose from, stick to the Divine plan of God; He knows how to make a possibility of all impossibilities. Be blessed!</p>
