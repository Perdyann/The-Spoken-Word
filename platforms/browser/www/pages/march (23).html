		  	<p><i>For as he thinketh in his heart, so is he: Eat and drink, saith he to thee; but his heart is not with thee. (Proverbs 23:7)</i></p>

		  	<blockquote>Transformation emanates from the discovery of the truth that we are nothing but our thoughts.</blockquote>

		  	<p>What’s the difference between the rich and poor? What’s the difference between the mighty and the little? What’s the difference between the brave and the coward? What’s the difference between the strong and the weak? What’s the difference between Joseph and his brothers? What’s the difference between David and Goliath?</p>
		  	<p>A thought says it all! The situations of many will never be transformed until they realize that they are what they think. I recall when Samuel was to anoint the next King to replace Saul.</p>
		  	<p><i>But the Lord said unto Samuel, Look not on his countenance, or on the height of his stature; because I have refused him: for the Lord seeth not as man seeth; for man looketh on the outward appearance, but the Lord looketh on the heart. (1 Samuel 16:7)</i></p>
		  	<p>The mistake, which many are in a haste to make, is judging a book by its cover. What made God to choose David over his brothers? If Samuel were to be in the position to choose, he would have made the wrong choice (Eliab).</p>
		  	<p>God foreknew that Eliab would not have been able to defeat Goliath, the way David did. David, although small in physique, was a giant in thoughts. He had the heart, thoughts, and mindset that his brothers never had.</p>
		  	<p>Joseph’s brothers had everything else, but the right thoughts. Unlike them, Joseph, while he was yet in his father’s house, thought himself to be great. There was nothing that pushed him faster to the place of greatness, than his thoughts, dreams and mindset.</p>
		  	<p>Transformation emanates from the discovery of the truth that we are nothing but our thoughts. Nothing separates a rich-thinking man from wealth; verily, a man that thinks great is great already.</p>
		  	<p>If all your hands are chained, and you cannot move, if all your properties are seized, and you are left with nothing, when all your strength is gone, and you cannot do anything else, think!</p>
		  	<p>There is no chain that is powerful enough to bind our thoughts. The handcuffs were powerful enough to bind together the hands of Joseph in the prison, but they were not as powerful as binding his thoughts.</p>
		  	<p>Beloved, you are what you think! Whenever I sit down to reflect on my life, I measure it with the Word of God. This gives me the understanding that I can do all things! Verily, I ceased to be limited the very day I embraced the thought that I am living beyond limits.</p>
		  	<p>Your immediate environment may not always bear witness with your thoughts. Situations may not always indicate that you’re heading anywhere good. Even if it doesn’t seem like it, think positive always! It is written:</p>
		  	<p><i>And be not conformed to this world: but be ye transformed by the renewing of your mind, that ye may prove what is that good, and acceptable, and perfect, will of God. (Romans 12:2)</i></p>
		  	<p>Our transformation proceeds from the renewal of our minds. In essence, the system of the world should not influence our thinking, but we should transform the world by our thoughts. You are what you think. Think right! Be blessed!</p>
