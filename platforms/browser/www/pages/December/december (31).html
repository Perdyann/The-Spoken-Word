		  	<p><i>Let us hear the conclusion of the whole matter: Fear God, and keep his commandments: for this is the whole duty of man. (Ecclesiastes 12:13)</i></p>
		  	

		  	<blockquote>There is nothing you ever do outside the fear of God that is successful. There is no better way to walk, than to walk in the fear of God. </blockquote>

		  	<p>Solomon is one who had experienced the heights of Wisdom any man could ever attain. He had lived an experienced life, married the most wives, and had a lot of concubines. Adding to that, he wrote lots of songs.</p>
		  	<p>He knew what it meant to be wise, and he knew what it meant to be foolish. He knew what it meant to be single, and he knew how it felt to be married. He understood how it was to obey God, and he knew what it meant to disobey God. There was hardly any experience that his life lacked.</p>
		  	<p>He experienced being average, as well as being excessively rich. He experienced being a normal man, as well as being a famous man. In all these experiences, he came up with a single conclusion — Fear God!</p>
		  	<p>The bible says, <i> “The fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom ...” (Proverbs 9:10).</i> Solomon’s wisdom began on this note — he had the fear of God. A time came when he drifted from that pattern, and acted as though he feared neither God nor man. He experienced the repercussions, and related it to how he was when he was led by the fear of God. Indeed, that birthed his conclusion. He said,<i> “Fear God... that’s the whole duty of man.”</i></p>
		  	<p>I agree absolutely with Him. Fearing God is the whole duty of man. Your purpose and assignment are in total alliance with the fear of God. There is nothing you ever do outside the fear of God that is successful.</p>
		  	<p>A man who has got the fear of God will despise sin; he will be careful to walk in the commandment of the Lord; he will ensure he acknowledges the Lord in all his steps. There is no better way to walk, than to walk in the fear of God. If Solomon, the wise, could boldly declare that the introduction and conclusion of everything is to fear God, then that’s indeed the key thing.</p>
		  	<p>The bible says, <i> “Wisdom is the principal thing; therefore get wisdom: and with all thy getting get understanding.” (Proverbs 4:7).</i> If wisdom is the principal thing, then it’s really important we get wisdom, and here is a simple key — Fear God!</p>
		  	<p>The fall of many great men began when they acted without the fear of God. If Saul feared God enough, he wouldn’t have spared anything from Amalek after God had commanded him to spare nothing. If Solomon continued in the fear of God, he would have hearkened when God told him not to marry foreign wives.</p>
		  	<p>Beloved, if you want to remain standing and you want to soar on greater heights, never stop fearing God. That’s wisdom. Be blessed!</p>
