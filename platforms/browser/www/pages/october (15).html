		  	<p><i>Do you not say, It is still four months until harvest time comes? Look! I tell you, raise your eyes and observe the fields and see how they are already white for harvesting. (John 4:35)</i></p>

		  	<blockquote>Stop trusting God to heal you before the year runs out. Why not now? God changeth not; He will not be more powerful tomorrow than He is today.</blockquote>

		  	<p>The season of harvest is a season of yielding and reaping; the Word of God makes us to understand that those who sow in tears will reap in joy (Psalm 126:5). The time of sowing might not have been so smooth, but I have great news today—it’s time to reap in joy.</p>
		  	<p>The harvest time is not in the future as we often assume, it is here already. It’s not in four years time, four months nor even four days; it is now! A pregnant woman, who is in labor, feels it within her that it is time to deliver.</p>
		  	<p>She is no longer counting down months and days, rather, she is certain that the time for delivery has arrived. Likewise beloved, you are pregnant with a Divine package, and the time for delivery is now.</p>
		  	<p>This scripture admonishes us not to expect our harvest in the future (four months), but to receive it now.</p>
		  	<p>You might have toiled for many years to break through; you might have struggled for ages; you might have been in your situation for too long; the harvest time is now. The bible declares,</p>
		  	<p><i> “Arise, shine; for thy light is come, and the glory of the Lord is risen upon thee.” (Isaiah 60:1)</i></p>
		  	<p>Notice, it is not said, “the light will come”, rather, we are assured that the light is come. Beloved verily, the light is here already, harvest time is now.</p>
		  	<p>The scripture today goes further to prove that if only you will raise your eyes and look, you will see that the harvest is here already. The issue with a lot of people is not that they lack solution; it’s just that they have not seen the solution yet.</p>
		  	<p>I remember when Hagar was sent packing with her son, and they ran out of water. They were at the verge of dying of thirst, when the Lord opened her eyes, and she saw the well of water behind her. Verily beloved, the solution to her thirst (the well) existed, but she never saw it until then.</p>
		  	<p>Many have languished and perished in their problems, not because it was beyond solution, but because they never raised their eyes to observe the fields of their harvest.</p>
		  	<p>Beloved, God is saying to you today, “Lift up your eyes and behold, the harvest is here already” Don’t perish in hunger, when the harvest is ripe.</p>
		  	<p>That infirmity has survived in your body for too long, light has come now; it is time for you to receive healing. Stop trusting God to heal you before the year runs out. Why not now? God changeth not; He will not be more powerful tomorrow than He is today.</p>
		  	<p>Your harvest is not tomorrow, it is now! Your light is not yet to come, it has come! Arise and shine beloved, can’t you see that the fields are already white for harvesting? Be blessed!</p>
