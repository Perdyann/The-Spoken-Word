		  <div class="panel-body" style="text-align:justify">


		  	<p><i>Trust in the Lord with all thine heart; and lean not unto thine own understanding.</i></p>
		  	<p><i>In all thy ways acknowledge him, and he shall direct thy paths.</i></p>
		  	<p><i>Be not wise in thine own eyes: fear the Lord, and depart from evil. (Proverbs 3:5-8)</i></p>


		  	<blockquote>It takes a man who have deliberately denied his understanding, and embraced revelation, to soar on greater divine heights. </blockquote>

		  	<p>The basic hindrance to being able to trust God is the human understanding. We have learnt so much from our past life experiences; we know how to distinguish possibilities from impossibilities. Thus, when God commands us to do something tasking, which we may have probably tagged as impossible, we tend to contradict God’s Word, by clinging solely to our understanding.</p>
		  	<p>When you lean on your understanding, you are limited to mediocrity; thus, the best you can ever produce, even in your greatest effort, is merely average.</p>
		  	<p>If Abraham had leaned on his own understanding, he wouldn’t have left his fatherland to an unknown place; if Abraham had leaned on his understanding, he wouldn’t have attempted to offer his son.</p>
		  	<p>After the birth of Jesus, if the three wise men had leaned on their own understanding, they would have surely returned to the King; if Moses had leaned on his understanding, he never would have been able to lead the Israelites out of Egypt.</p>
		  	<p>If David had leaned on his understanding, he wouldn’t have dared Goliath; if Esther had leaned on her understanding, she wouldn’t have risked her life to enter the King’s domain against his command.</p>
		  	<p>Men that fulfilled purpose, at some point denied their understanding. The lives of these fellows defined greatness.</p>
		  	<p>It takes a man who have deliberately denied his understanding, and embraced revelation, to soar on greater divine heights.</p>
		  	<p>Rather than lean on your understanding, <i>‘In all thy ways acknowledge him, and he shall direct thy paths.’ </i> There is no better insurance than God’s Word. By His Word, we can boldly declare that we are on the right track, our paths are straight and our future is insured.</p>
		  	<p>Furthermore, it is said, <i> ‘Be not wise in thine own eyes: fear the Lord, and depart from evil.’ </i> Pharaoh regarded himself as wise in his own eyes; that’s why each time his people were plagued, and he released the Israelites, he will go after them again. He sure thought he could outwit God.</p>
		  	<p>Sometimes, those actions of ours, which we regard wise, are considered folly in the eyes of God. God requires us to be men of revelation, who have intentionally defied human understanding and wisdom.</p>
		  	<p>When you insist on your will, and cling firmly to your understanding, you remain restricted to a narrowly confined boundary. However, men of faith and revelation live beyond limits whatsoever! Be blessed!</p>
