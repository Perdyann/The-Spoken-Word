		  	<p><i>And I, if I be lifted up from the earth, will draw all men unto me.</i></p>
		  	<p><i>This he said, signifying what death he should die. (John 12:32-33)</i></p>

		  	<blockquote>God has promised to draw us above every ill situation; never think more on your problems than God’s promises!</blockquote>

		  	<p>There is only one condition to being transposed to God’s realm of Life; it is that Christ be lifted up.</p>
		  	<p>I always thought that lifting Christ up requires our personal efforts, until I came to the realization that He has already been lifted up. Meditating on the lines, you will observe that what Christ meant by being lifted up from the earth was the death, which he was to face for our sake.</p>
		  	<p>If Christ has died and resurrected, it means that He has been lifted up, and drawn us to His realm of glory already.</p>
		  	<p>Jesus did not promise to draw us unto Him, when He is still in the earth, but when He has been glorified. In essence, we are being drawn to a realm of glory, residing with God.</p>
		  	<p>Therefore brethren, we must understand that our physical bodies might be in the earth, but we operate from a higher spiritual realm.</p>
		  	<p>The only reason why people remain bound and confined within the ill circumstances of the earthly realm, is that they are not yet knowledgeable of the realm, to which we have all been called.</p>
		  	<p>Christ did not come for nothing; so much was stamped by his death and resurrection. His death crushed sickness, death, poverty, failure, and sin; His rising however, released us to a realm of health, wealth, success, righteousness and love.</p>
		  	<p>Beloved, we are drawn unto God; it means that we dwell in the same realm with God. When you remain conformed to the world, its system, rules and principles, you are only degrading yourself.</p>
		  	<p>Verily, whenever God is lifted up, men are drawn up. You might be going through series of challenges, but understand that if you lift God above your challenges, He will draw you up above it.</p>
		  	<p>The only problem is that men love to magnify their challenges; they unconsciously exalt their challenges over God, by paying more attention to it than God.</p>
		  	<p>Beloved, the only way to stand above all odds is to glorify God even in your challenges. God has promised to draw us above every ill situation; never think more on your problems than God’s promises! Be blessed!</p>
