		  	<p><i>I have made the earth, and created man upon it: I, even my hands, have stretched out the heavens, and all their host have I commanded.</i></p>
		  	<p><i>I have raised him up in righteousness, and I will direct all his ways: he shall build my city, and he shall let go my captives, not for price nor reward, saith the Lord of hosts. (Isaiah 45:12-13)</i></p>

		  	<blockquote>The attitude of seeking a price or reward for every service only makes you a liability. True servants are willing to serve, irrespective of price or reward. </blockquote>

		  	<p>God has appointed Ministers to build His holy city and let the captives go. Most importantly He adds, “Not for price nor reward.” When we compare this scripture to the Ministers of this age, all we observe is the glaring contrast.</p>
		  	<p>Who is a Minister? The word Minister means ‘servant’, therefore, in order to be a minister, you must be ready to serve. God does not just refer to it as service, but a service done not for price nor reward.</p>
		  	<p>In a world where virtually everyone has embraced the saying, “nothing goes for free.” People are not willing to serve without a price or reward; if not in cash or kind, they opt for connection and fame.</p>
		  	<p>People are no longer willing to invest in people, whom they don’t think they’d ever need; people are no longer willing to give to the needy that have nothing to give in return; they are not willing to liberate the captives that cannot pay back; they are not willing to edify the body of Christ, without a tangible reward.</p>
		  	<p>Beloved, the attitude of seeking a price or reward for every service only makes you a liability. True servants are willing to serve, irrespective of price or reward.</p>
		  	<p>So often, people serve with so much honor and respect, those that are willing to reward them; but disregard those, whom they think they don’t need outright.</p>
		  	<p>Rather than focusing on the Divine assignment and task, some servants focus on the price and reward. People, who are yet to discover purpose, are after reward; but a man with a purpose and passion takes pleasure in getting the task done, to the glory of God.</p>
		  	<p>Beloved, there is a Divine wake-up call; many have derailed from the gospel; many have compromised to obtain a price or reward; many have drifted their focus from the gospel of the Kingdom, to their opinions, which they think will get them a price faster. Finally beloved,</p>
		  	<p><i>And whatsoever ye do, do it heartily, as to the Lord, and not unto men; (Colossians 3:23)</i></p>
		  	<p>Serve diligently in everything, as though you were serving God and not man. Don’t be after the reward or price; be after living a purpose-driven life. Be blessed!</p>
