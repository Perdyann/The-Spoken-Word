		  	<p><i>But you are a chosen group of people. You are the King’s religious leaders. You are a holy nation. You belong to God. He has done this for you so you can tell others how God has called you out of darkness into His great light. (1 Peter 2:9)</i></p>


		  	<blockquote>In saving you, God saved a generation! Let no one ever meet you and remain the same. Be the change the world groans for. Go tell it on the mountains! </blockquote>

		  	<p>When God releases a blessing to a man, it does not solely rest upon that man, but spreads like a wild fire, transforming everyone that comes in contact with him, thereby, reaching out to an entire generation.</p>
		  	<p>There are so many great things that we have been given access to as Sons of God. We get to understand more about our purpose on earth, and that’s not an understanding we choose to keep to ourselves. The more of God we unveil daily, the more we are propelled to share the Gospel.</p>
		  	<p>Sometimes, I am moved to tears, when I consider the place where God’s mercy located me from. David quoted in Psalms 51, “Behold, I was shapen in iniquity; and in sin did my mother conceive me.” Verily, that’s exactly how I lived in darkness all along.</p>
		  	<p>I was so entangled in my life in the flesh, and I gave room for my desires to be the lord of my life. Indeed, there’s nothing so deserving of God’s love which I did. Now I understand why it is written:</p>
		  	<p><i>But God commendeth his love toward us, in that, while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us. (Romans 5:8)</i></p>
		  	<p>Again it is written:</p>
		  	<p><i>Even when we were dead (slain) by [our own] shortcomings and trespasses, He made us alive together in fellowship and in union with Christ; [He gave us the very life of Christ Himself, the same new life with which He quickened Him, for] it is by grace (His favor and mercy which you did not deserve) that you are saved (delivered from judgment and made partakers of Christ’s salvation). (Ephesians 2:5 AMP)</i></p>
		  	<p>Beloved, it is obvious that God loved us, even while we were yet soaked in our iniquities. His love for us did not start when we became born again, but He loved us before we were formed.</p>
		  	<p>God could have chosen anyone, but why Saul? It is he who persecuted the church . . . Indeed, God shows us love, mercy and salvation, even when we don’t deserve it. We should respond just like Paul did; he proclaimed the Word of God everywhere.</p>
		  	<p>Sometime ago, I sat down and thought of strategies of soul-winning. In no time, I realized that my testimony is powerful enough to win, inspire and motivate a soul. Keeping it to myself is as bad as hiding a lamp under a bushel.</p>
		  	<p>There is something that happens when you get saved; you can’t just remain silent about it. You would wish to have your family and friends partake in the blessings as well.</p>
		  	<p>Beloved, in saving you, God saved a generation! Let no one ever meet you and remain the same. We live God’s Life now; God never left things the same way. Be the change the world groans for. Go tell it on the mountains!</p>
