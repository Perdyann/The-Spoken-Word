		  	<p><i>And it came to pass, as they fled from before Israel, and were in the going down to Bethhoron, that the Lord cast down great stones from heaven upon them unto Azekah, and they died: they were more which died with hailstones than they whom the children of Israel slew with the sword.</i></p>
		  	<p><i>And there was no day like that before it or after it, that the Lord hearkened unto the voice of a man: for the Lord fought for Israel. (Joshua 10:11 &14)</i></p>

		  	<blockquote>Until you get to understand that victory has already been won, you will keep fighting for trophies that are already yours’</blockquote>

		  	<p>The battle was not won by the ability of the Israelites to fight. The heavenly weapons that consumed the enemies were worth more than the weapons of the Israelites.</p>
		  	<p>The wining team is not the team that has more resources, members or tactics, but the team, which God leads. It is written, <i>“What shall we then say to these things? If God be for us, who can be against us?” (Romans 8:30)</i></p>
		  	<p> It is written,<i> ‘for the Lord fought for Israel’ Notice the use of the past-tense, ‘fought’.</i> Move with this confidence, God is not fighting for you; He has already fought for you. Receive victory over every situation in life.</p>
		  	<p>Until you get to understand that victory has already been won, you will keep fighting for trophies that are already yours’</p>
		  	<p>I always thought that poverty, failure, defeat, and sickness were mountains that I had to overcome through my ability to fight. Thus, for many years, I struggled trying to live above all these; until I realized that the battle is not mine to fight, but God.</p>
		  	<p>Beloved, when you are in Christ, your battle ceases to be yours’. Therefore, there is no need to worry or be anxious about anything; just relax, be still and watch God present you new victories every new day. The victory over everything is won already.</p>
		  	<p><i>But he was wounded for our transgressions, he was bruised for our iniquities: the chastisement of our peace was upon him; and with his stripes we are healed. (Isaiah 53:5)</i></p>
		  	<p>The victory over sickness has been won; Christ fought for us! He defeated sickness with his stripes.</p>
		  	<p><i>For ye know the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, that, though he was rich, yet for your sakes he became poor, that ye through his poverty might be rich. (2 Corinthians 8:9)</i></p>
		  	<p>The victory over poverty has been won; Christ fought for us! The only reason why He became poor was for us to gain wealth. Poverty was defeated long ago.</p>
		  	<p><i>For sin shall not have dominion over you: for ye are not under the law, but under grace. (Romans 6:4)</i></p>
		  	<p>The victory over sin has been won; Sin was introduced by the law; therefore, if we are no longer under the law, then we can no longer be held captive by sin. Christ became sin, that we may be made the righteousness of God.</p>
		  	<p><i>For whatsoever is born of God overcometh the world: and this is the victory that overcometh the world, even our faith. (1 John 5:4)</i></p>
		  	<p>The victory over defeat has been won! We have overcome already. Christ fought for us!</p>
		  	<p>Beloved, if Christ could pay the price for our health, success, wealth, and victory; what other mountain could keep us limited? We should not be held bound by any ill circumstance anymore; the Lord has fought for us. Be blessed!</p>
