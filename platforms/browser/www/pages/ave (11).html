		  	<p><i>Christ gave you the Holy Spirit and He lives in you. You do not need anyone to teach you. The Holy Spirit is able to teach you all things. What He teaches you is truth and not a lie. Live by the help of Christ as the Holy Spirit has taught you. (1 John 2:27 NLV)</i></p>


		  	<blockquote>More than we persuade people to get mentors, we should encourage them to hear from God. Don’t try to get yourself a mentor; it is the Lord that gives mentors! </blockquote>

		  	<p>No one can lead you like the Holy Spirit; He is our leader and teacher! This does not mean that the office of a teacher and other spiritual offices are not necessary.</p>
		  	<p>Verily, a genuine leader will not just have you depend absolutely on him, but will teach you to relate better with the Holy Spirit.</p>
		  	<p>As much as it is good to be mentored, and led by men, who have been through the bridge, on which we currently stand, it is better to cling to the personal leadings of the Holy Spirit. There are times when men, no matter how anointed they might be, could falter. However, the Word of the Spirit is reliable.</p>
		  	<p>Don’t rely on the sermons alone; go into your private place, study and meditate on the Word of God. The Holy Spirit will always speak and give you deeper understanding and direction.</p>
		  	<p>We should be discerning enough to understand which sermon is Spirit inspired, and which is merely prompted by the Preacher’s opinion and earthly experiences.</p>
		  	<p>Beloved, this is what the Word says, <i> “You do not need anyone to teach you. The Holy Spirit is able to teach you all things.” </i> Verily, it is good to be taught by men, but it is mandatory to be led by the Spirit of God. In essence, if at any point, the words we are taught, contradicts what the Holy Spirit says, we should stick to what the Spirit says. What He teaches you is truth and not a lie.</p>
		  	<p>I have said often, I can do without anyone, but God. Sometimes, we persuade people to get mentors. I believe that more than we persuade them to get mentors, we should encourage them to hear from God. When they relate well with the Holy Spirit, He will give them a mentor that suits them.</p>
		  	<p>The bible says, nothing good will he withhold from us (Psalm 84:11). In essence, God will give us a mentor just when He deems it right and good for us.</p>
		  	<p>I don’t just want people to be mentored, but to be mentored rightly. There are many wolves in sheep clothing! Persuading someone to grab a mentor by himself is no different from pushing him into the care of a wolf. Don’t try to get yourself a mentor; it is the Lord that gives mentors!</p>
		  	<p>The Holy Spirit is all we need for a lifetime; in Him, we can be sure of being led rightly. Beloved, I say this, because I have be led rightly by some men, and misled by some other mentors. It is very good to be mentored, but better to mentored rightly.</p>
		  	<p>Here’s the difference between men and the Holy Spirit:</p>
		  	<p>Men will walk away when you need them most; they may try to use you for their own glory; they are only with you because of what they stand to gain from you; when they feel they’ve had enough of you, they may quit; they can give up on you; they can desert you in your mistakes. Beloved, the arm of the flesh will fail, but God never fails!</p>
		  	<p>God never walks away; He is in through thick and thin. When I had nothing else but my breath; when all my strength was gone; when everyone had walked away; when I had given up on myself. He held me by the right hand, walked in me through my fears, and led me to the place of my purpose.</p>
		  	<p>Beloved, the Holy Spirit is always there to give us what no man in his greatest ability could ever give. He is here to teach us what no man in his highest wisdom and knowledge could ever comprehend or teach. He is here to lead us in a way no man, in his best visual ability, could ever direct us.</p>
		  	<p>Quit all vain pursuits, stop trying to get the attention of any man, just be still, and above all, ‘Live by the help of Christ as the Holy Spirit has taught you.’ Be blessed!</p>
