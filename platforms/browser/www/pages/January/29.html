		  	<p><i>“Thou shalt also decree a thing, and it shall be established unto thee: and the light shall shine upon thy ways.” (Job 22:28).</i></p>
		  	


		  	<blockquote>When a man complains, his predicaments are prolonged; when he makes a confession, great transformations occur.</blockquote>

		  	<p>Whatsoever it is you desire, start by speaking. Confess it! What have you said today? Whatever the problem is, speak life to it. God is getting ready to establish someone; all He is waiting for is your decree. There are millions of angels at your command; all they do is to wait for your decree. </p>
		  	<p>This particular passage opens my eye to the truth that in most cases, our establishment is dependent on our decrees (not complain). It is one thing to be in an unpleasant situation, and begin to complain... It is a totally different thing to handle that situation by a decree.</p>
		  	<p>When a man complains, his predicaments are prolonged; when he makes a confession, great transformations occur. If your financial situation isn’t pleasant, decree! When you need a job, decree! When you need growth, decree! When you need divine ideas and strategies, decree! C’mon, your angels have been standing idle for so long just because you haven’t said it yet. Take a good look at this:</p>
		  	<p><i>This day will the LORD deliver thee into mine hand; and I will smite thee, and take thine head from thee; and I will give the carcases of the host of the Philistines this day unto the fowls of the air, and to the wild beasts of the earth; that all the earth may know that there is a God in Israel. (1 Samuel 17:46)</i></p>
		  	<p>It was not the cheer from the crowd that encouraged David to kill Goliath, it was his decree. Beloved, even before the battle began, David had already looked Goliath in the eye to make some deadly decrees... I must say here, David had already defeated Goliath long ago by his confessions. From the moment he began to make that decree in verse 46, the victory was won!</p>
		  	<p>Cutting Goliath’s head with his own sword was just a physical manifestation of what David had already decreed long ago. The victory never laid in the actions of David, but in the Spirit, mind and decrees he had.</p>
		  	<p>Have you sought victory for too long? Have you been in your situation for too long? Do you desire a change in any aspect? Then it’s time to make some provocative decrees. God has promised establishments of your words, only confess it!</p>
