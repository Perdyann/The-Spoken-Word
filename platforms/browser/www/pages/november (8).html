		  	<p><i>Stand therefore, having your loins girt about with truth, and having on the breastplate of righteousness; (Ephesians 6:14)</i></p>
		
		  	<blockquote>If indeed righteousness is achieved by our works, then Christ died for no purpose.</blockquote>

		  	<p>Righteousness is a spiritual weapon just like the breastplate is a physical armor. The function of the breastplate is to prevent injuries; likewise, there is a lot of havoc that will be averted when a man gets to understand his righteous stand in Christ.</p>
		  	<p>The issue of righteousness has brought about conflicting opinions; many lack the understanding of righteousness, thus are limited by their minds in every way. Righteousness is a key equipment, and until you grasp it in full, you are not well equipped. The bible says,</p>
		  	<p><i>For he hath made him to be sin for us, who knew no sin; that we might be made the righteousness of God in him. (2 Corinthians 5:21)</i></p>
		  	<p>If indeed righteousness is achieved by our works, then Christ died for no purpose. Righteousness is a free gift, which we have received. It gives us a right standing in the presence of God.</p>
		  	<p>So often, people have asked me to pray for them; indeed, I pray for as many as I can, but I don’t think God hears my prayer better than He hears the prayer of another born-again person.</p>
		  	<p>Many Christians get it wrong here: they are of the opinion that God will listen to their Pastors better than He will listen to them, because they feel that their Pastors are more righteous than they. That mindset is a great limitation, because it deprives a man of the knowledge of who he is in Christ.</p>
		  	<p>I wouldn’t be glad to have everyone run to me for prayers always; even the least believer should understand His righteous stand in Christ. So many doctrines have blinded the minds of people.</p>
		  	<p>Righteousness is not achieved by our works; Christ did not die for Pastors alone, but everyone. Thus, everyone who has received Christ has received righteousness (a right-standing in His presence). God will hear your prayer as well as He hears that of your Pastor.</p>
		  	<p>When you lack an understanding of your righteous stand in Christ, you’d always feel too condemned to dwell in God’s presence, thus, you’d remain vulnerable—an available prey for the enemy.</p>
		  	<p>An understanding of your righteous stand is a key spiritual weapon (breastplate), which prevents injuries. Be blessed!</p>
