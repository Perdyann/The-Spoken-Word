		  	<p><i>Let this mind be in you, which was also in Christ Jesus:</i></p>
		  	<p><i>Who, being in the form of God, thought it not robbery to be equal with God:</i></p>
		  	<p><i>But made himself of no reputation, and took upon him the form of a servant, and was made in the likeness of men:</i></p>
		  	<p><i>And being found in fashion as a man, he humbled himself, and became obedient unto death, even the death of the cross. (Philippians 2:5-8)</i></p>
		

		  	<blockquote>If you are able to blend the personality of Christ with Kingdom principles, you have made it!</blockquote>

		  	<p>I’ve asked a lot of people, “Why did Jesus come?” This particular question has resulted in so many different answers and at some point, ushered controversy. Some said, “Jesus came to restore what Adam lost”, and others argued that what Jesus came to do isn’t to restore the loss of Adam but to give us something better. </p>
		  	<p>Some said, “Jesus came to die”, and others argued, “He didn’t just come to die, for if that was His sole reason for coming, He wouldn’t have resurrected. Most verily, the critics were right, He didn’t just come to die, but to give life, adding to that, He came to show the way, that we may follow.</p>
		  	<p>We should walk in the footsteps of Jesus. He came as the Son of God, to show us how to operate as Sons of God upon the earth. His life was a lesson for all mankind. His teachings are well spiced up with principles, and a reflection of his personality.</p>
		  	<p>The principles in the Word of God are the things that cause the earth to yield to a man . . . The principle of giving results in receiving; the principle of confession results in the establishment of our words; the principles of sowing results in reaping, amongst others.”</p>
		  	<p>Verily, it is impossible to see a man, who deliberately walks in these principles, that is not successful. When a man discovers great principles, and puts them to effect in his life, he becomes prosperous, and other men will marvel at his kind. However, the God-life is not defined by principles alone, but by the personality.</p>
		  	<p>The principles of the Word of God can make the earth to yield to you, but it is only the personality of Christ that gives a man direct access to the Kingdom of heaven.</p>
		  	<p>The scripture above carefully quotes, <i> ‘let this mind be in you which was in Christ Jesus’, </i> each day of our lives should shape to become more of Jesus . . . The personality of Christ encompasses holiness, humility, obedience, sacrifice, discipline and love.</p>
		  	<p>Without a blend of His personality, no man can see God. I am therefore not surprised when the bible says, <i> “Without holiness, no man can see God.” (Hebrews 12:14) </i> Don’t let your ‘Christianity’ be founded on just the principles, and not the personality. The principles speak well for a man on earth, but it is only the personality that qualifies a man when all the earth is passed away, and we stand in the other realm. Reading further, the bible says,</p>
		  	<p><i>“... work out your own salvation with fear and trembling.” (Philippians 2:12)</i></p>
		  	<p>Salvation at last is of more value, than earthly success. There are very anointed men of God, who still struggle with sexual immorality, and other fleshly passions. This is for no other reason than, having a wrong foundation in Christianity. Let everything be founded on the personality of Christ (love, holiness, humility, etc), and then, the principles, can be blended with it to produce a very effective result.</p>
		  	<p>So many others are genuinely anointed by God, but because of their lack of consciousness to the personality of Christ, flies have perched into the oil and caused it to start stinking. It’s time for a revival, embrace His personality, let the flies go, that your oil may be fresh again.</p>
		  	<p>The principles are given for us all to follow, but the personality is given as a foundation to all things. A man founded on the principles may miss it out somewhere, but there is no man, whose life is founded and defined by the personality of Christ, that can ever be overcome.</p>
		  	<p>Beloved, I admonish you all not to lay your foundation on the principles, but the personality. If you are able to blend the personality of Christ with Kingdom principles, you have made it! Be blessed!</p>
