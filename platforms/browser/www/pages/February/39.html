		  <div class="panel-body" style="text-align:justify">
		

		  	<p><i>That the trial of your faith, being much more precious than of gold that perisheth, though it be tried with fire, might be found unto praise and honour and glory at the appearing of Jesus Christ: (1 Peter 1:7)</i></p>
		


		  	<blockquote>The destination of any trial is glory. Trials are not intended to break you, but to make you... It is an inevitable route to glory.</blockquote>

		  	<p>Your faith must stand trials. I am yet to see a man of Faith that has not been tried. So often, I thought to myself, “Why does the breakthrough and overflow always tarry till the last hour?” Indeed, your faith must be tried and tested to be genuine. I am therefore not surprised when James quotes;</p>
		  	<p><i>Knowing this, that the trying of your faith worketh patience. (James 1:3)</i></p>
		  	<p>When God gives you a Word, and you act upon it with faith, sometimes, the expected result tarries . . . This is just to test the veritability of your faith. Be patient even in tough times, for though it tarries, it will surely come to pass.</p>
		  	<p>The destination of any trial is glory. Trials are not intended to break you, but to make you. There is strength in understanding that a trial is never complete until the glory is revealed. If it hadn’t been for the trial, Jesus may not have been glorified... If it hadn’t been for the trial, Abraham may not have been glorified. If you are a man of faith, get ready to be tried. The Psalmist says,</p>
		  	<p><i>Thou hast caused men to ride over our heads; we went through fire and through water: but thou broughtest us out into a wealthy place. (Psalm 66:12)</i></p>
		  	<p>The sole purpose of the trial that had to get you in the fire is to release you to a wealthy place. You only went through all you’ve been through, in order to be aligned to your destiny. Just like the Israelites, you’d never get to the promise land, without passing through series of trials in the desert. God never promised to keep us from the fire. He rather says, <i> “When you go through fire, I’d be with you” (Isaiah 43:2) </i> He didn’t prevent Shedrach, Meshach and Abednego from being thrown into the fire, but he was with them.</p>
		  	<p><i>For our light affliction, which is but for a moment, worketh for us a far more exceeding and eternal weight of glory; (2 Corinthians 4:17)</i></p>
		  	<p>Trials last just for a moment, before it launches us to glory. The issue is, many are not patient enough to endure the split second of light afflictions, and so, they are defeated. Beloved, be patient even in trial. It is an inevitable route to glory.</p>
		  	<p>We’ve studied a lot about faith recently, but most importantly, we must understand that as much as it is necessary to have faith in order to receive from God, we should also be prepared for trials... It is inevitable.</p>
		  	<p>Abraham had faith enough to leave his fatherland to an unknown place; even so, his faith had to be tried... He had to be willing to offer his only son. Peter had enough faith to dare to walk with Jesus on water, but his faith had to be tested, in order for him to be sustained on top of the water. Is your faith strong enough to stand the test? Your faith must stand trials... Exercise it! Be blessed!</p>
