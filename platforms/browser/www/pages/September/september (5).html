		  	<p><i>Then the king made Daniel a great man, and gave him many great gifts, and made him ruler over the whole province of Babylon, and chief of the governors over all the wise men of Babylon.</i></p>
		  	<p><i>Then the king promoted Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, in the province of Babylon. (Daniel 2:48 & 3:30)</i></p>
		  	
		  	<blockquote>Be authentic, genuine and true; don’t try to imitate everyone else; you might be the only right person.</blockquote>

		  	<p>In the first Chapter of the book of Daniel, these four men — Daniel, Shedrach, Meshach and Abednego — set a standard of being undefiled, yet looking more refreshed. They had proven how wise they were; but in subsequent chapters, their authenticity had to be tested.</p>
		  	<p>In the second chapter, Daniel’s ability to narrate and interpret dreams was tested. In the third chapter, Shedrach, Meshach and Abednego were tested by the fiery furnace. These fellows overcame the test!</p>
		  	<p>In all cases, after the test was done, promotion was made. Daniel was made a ruler over the province of Babylon, while, his colleagues were promoted in the same province.</p>
		  	<p>Daniel’s life was at stake; Shedrach, Meshach and Abednego were thrown into the fire. However, just after the test, they were released into a wealthy place.</p>
		  	<p>Don’t moan when you find yourself in the fire; don’t moan when your life is threatened; don’t moan when you are afflicted in diverse ways; just understand that you are being tested, and there will be a great reward after the test.</p>
		  	<p>These fellows had proven to Nebuchadnezzar, how authentic they were. He was convinced beyond doubt that they serve a Great God. This particularly prompted him to promote them.</p>
		  	<p>Remain authentic; if you have set the standard of not being defiled, then, don’t let anyone or anything get you defiled.</p>
		  	<p>Remain genuine; if you have set a standard not to worship any idol, then, don’t even let the heat of the fiery furnace make you to compromise.</p>
		  	<p>You don’t need to bow to that idol because the crowd is doing same; you don’t need to let the actions of worldly people define your own actions. Live by your standard, even if you are the only one.</p>
		  	<p>Be authentic, genuine and true; don’t try to imitate everyone else; you might be the only right person.</p>
		  	<p>Beloved, what is that godly standard, which you have set? Understand that you will be tested in all ways, but as long as you are able to endure till the end, and prove your authenticity, you will be greatly rewarded. Be blessed!</p>
