		  	<p><i>Then he said to Gehazi, Gird up thy loins, and take my staff in thine hand, and go thy way: if thou meet any man, salute him not; and if any salute thee, answer him not again: and lay my staff upon the face of the child.</i></p>
		  	<p><i>And Gehazi passed on before them, and laid the staff upon the face of the child; but there was neither voice, nor hearing. Wherefore he went again to meet him, and told him, saying, The child is not awaked. (2 Kings 4:29&31)</i></p>
		  

		  	<blockquote>A staff in the wrong hand cannot produce the right result; the healing is not in the staff, but in the hand that holds it. </blockquote>

		  	<p>The solution is not in the staff, but in the hands of he, who owns it. After the Shunammite woman had lost her son, Elisha handed his staff over to Gehazi, sending him to go and lay it on the child, that his life should be restored.</p>
		  	<p>I wondered why the staff could not bring the child back to life, until Elisha personally went to the child. In no time, I realized that a staff in the wrong hand cannot produce the right result. In essence, the healing is not in the staff, but in the hand that holds it.</p>
		  	<p>Gehazi was not in the right position to hold the staff; he was not the one anointed and appointed to use it.</p>
		  	<p>Beloved, it is obvious that you can never get positive results when you try to force yourself into a wrong office; stop trying to fit your feet into shoes that are not yours’. Imitation is the greatest limitation of man.</p>
		  	<p>There is nothing as fulfilling as finding your right office and functioning in it; there is nothing as great as running the race on the right track.</p>
		  	<p>Notice, Gehazi attempt to restore the child with the staff of Elisha only yielded delay; in that, he spent time returning to report the futility of his mission to Elisha, and Elisha eventually had to go personally.</p>
		  	<p>Beloved, there is no point running a race on the wrong track; even if you are the first to cross the finishing line, the track on which you ran, will still be the factor that proves your worthiness for the crown.</p>
		  	<p>Running on the wrong track disqualifies you from the race, after much effort and toil has been invested. Likewise, functioning in the wrong office, not only delays the result, but disqualifies you, after making vain your initial efforts.</p>
		  	<p>Don’t waste your time embarking on a mission that is not yours’; don’t waste your effort on an assignment that is not yours’; don’t force yourself into an office that you are not called to.</p>
		  	<p>Let your purpose determine the call you should respond to or ignore. As long as the staff in your hand is not yours’, it can never grant you your desired result.</p>
		  	<p>Quit clinging unto a staff that is not yours; quit running on a track that is not yours; discover your path in the Word, and walk diligently in it. Be blessed!</p>
