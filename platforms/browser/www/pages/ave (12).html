		  <div class="panel-body" style="text-align:justify">


		  	<p><i>He who cultivates his land will have plenty of bread, but he who follows worthless people and pursuits will have poverty enough. (Proverbs 28:19 AMP)</i></p>


		  	<blockquote>I am yet to see a man, who God gave in details the entire course of his life beforehand. There are many things I know about my purpose today, which I didn’t understand yesterday. </blockquote>

		  	<p>To every man, there is a purpose and a mandate to be fulfilled. We all have callings, not necessarily to an office; it is expected of everyman to live up to his calling, and to fulfil every mandate of his.</p>
		  	<p>The reward of working in your land is food, and the consequence of wasting time, pursuing worthless people and agenda’s is poverty.</p>
		  	<p>Land is a representation of the field and area of your call; we are all called into different fields. The scripture quotes, <i> ‘He who cultivates his land’ </i> Notice, it does not just speak about cultivation of any land, but your own land. In essence, it is an error for you to be caught working in another man’s land.</p>
		  	<p>No matter how good your agendas may seem, if it is outside your field, then you have derailed from cultivating your land, to that of another man. Every assignment has got a land, therefore, your assignment has got a boundary; it is important to work within that boundary. Don’t step out of your assignment.</p>
		  	<p>Food — the reward of cultivating your land — is a representation of necessity, wants and desires.</p>
		  	<p>I never knew people could be worthless. Yea, some people are only but a distraction; they try to lure you back to the past you have refused to re-visit. Such people are not worth your time!</p>
		  	<p>Every vision selects its own friends; your deliberate decision to keep mingling with worthless people, despite all odds, will only result in poverty. Be careful not to pursue wrong agendas. So many ideas seem great and lucrative, but we need to be sure that we are working within the concise of our purpose and call.</p>
		  	<p>Here’s what the Lord is saying, “To him who does all that I have called him to do, he shall not want; but to those, who will rather waste their time and resources, in pursuit of worthless people, wrong agendas, worldly passions, and desires of the flesh, they shall indeed be poor.” It is written:</p>
		  	<p><i>“ ... For unto whomsoever much is given, of him shall be much required: and to whom men have committed much, of him they will ask the more.” (Luke 12:48)</i></p>
		  	<p>To whom much is given, much is expected; God has given each man a land, what he expects of us is cultivation.</p>
		  	<p>Brethren, if you don’t know your field yet, don’t start cultivation. This worst that could happen to a man is to realize that he has wasted all his time, strength, passion and resources, pursuing the wrong agendas.</p>
		  	<p>How can I discover my purpose and walk in it? So many people have posed this question to me.</p>
		  	<p>Verily, there is no purpose outside of God. To discover purpose, you must start by discovering God. Until you have the Holy Spirit resident in you, you may never get to understand Divine purpose.</p>
		  	<p>I am yet to see a man, who God gave in details the entire course of his life beforehand. God always wants us to unveil more truth about our lives and purpose in the continuous process of walking in Him. There are many things I know about my purpose today, which I didn’t understand yesterday.</p>
		  	<p>Spend time to meditate on the Word of God and incubate your vision; get wisdom from the Word of God, and never cease to declare Rhema. As long as you remain in the right course, God will continually shower you with Divine ideas and strategies. Be blessed!</p>
