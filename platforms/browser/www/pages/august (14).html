		  	<p><i>Constantly praising God and being in favor and goodwill with all the people; (Acts 2:47a AMP)</i></p>
		  


		  	<blockquote>If you keep waiting for everything to be alright before you praise, nothing will ever be right. Praise is what makes everything right! </blockquote>

		  	<p>Despite the persecutions faced; despite the oppositions they met; despite the challenges encountered; despite all that had been done, the believers of the Early Church still praised God.</p>
		  	<p>There’s something about the early church; they were passionately sold out and devoted to the work of God; they never cared about pain, all they did was to praise.</p>
		  	<p>When they were caught up in ill situations, they praised their way out; when they were cuffed with chains, they praised the chains off; through praise, they constantly changed their situations.</p>
		  	<p>It is important to note, regarding this scripture, that just immediately after their attitude of praise is portrayed, a reward of increase is pronounced. In essence, their praise made way for them to be increased.</p>
		  	<p>Beloved, through praise, you can make a change to your situation. Through praise, you can increase your finances; through praise you can maximize your potentials; through praise, you can attain heights, which ordinarily, are not possible to achieve.</p>
		  	<p>If you keep waiting for everything to be alright before you praise, nothing will ever be right. Praise is what makes everything right!</p>
		  	<p>If the early Church could praise God against all odds, we have no reason not to praise.</p>
		  	<p>We might not have faced half as much as they did; our burdens may not be half as heavy as theirs; but they put aside every weight, burden, pain, challenge, trial, and opposition, and decided to praise.</p>
		  	<p>Praise is not a feeling but a decision; sometimes, considering the odd situations we face, we might not feel like praising; don’t wait to feel like praising before you do; decide to praise God in all seasons.</p>
		  	<p>Naturally, the seasons define our actions; during winter, we wear coats, but during summer, we do away with the coats. Quite unlike this, praise is supernatural; it knows no season! There is no time when it is not needed.</p>
		  	<p>In describing the extent of praise done by the Early Church, the term ‘constantly’ is used. In essence, the seasons may have changed, but there was no time when they ceased to praise.</p>
		  	<p>Just like the early church praised without ceasing at all seasons, and received increase, we should understand that the change we desire is birthed from our level of praise.</p>
		  	<p>The body of Christ is known for its great virtue of praise. Remember, through praise, you can rewrite every situation. Be blessed!</p>
