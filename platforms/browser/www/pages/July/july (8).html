		  	<p><i>Behold, there is a people come out of Egypt, which covereth the face of the earth: come now, curse me them; peradventure I shall be able to overcome them, and drive them out.</i></p>

		  	<blockquote>Some things that are not wrong are not right either What qualifies any action to be right is the approval of the Lord. </blockquote>

		  	<p>How often do we inquire of the Lord, before we proceed in action? There are some things, which seem very convenient for us to do, and weighing every factor, it is obvious that these things are not wrong in any way.</p>
		  	<p>Most often, we proceed to do such things, not because God has told us to, but because we feel that there’s nothing wrong with it. It is important to understand that doing right, is not abstaining from wrong deeds, but deliberately doing right things.</p>
		  	<p>What qualifies any action to be right is the approval of the Lord. It is a good thing to host crusades, but it is not the right thing to do when the Lord has not released you to do so.</p>
		  	<p>Here’s where everything is headed to: Some decisions we make are morally right, but if we make them without enquiring of the Lord we have not acted right.</p>
		  	<p>The scripture above highlights the event that occurred between Balak and Balaam. Balak had persuaded Balaam to lay curses on a certain nation. Balaam knew that he had the ability to lay curses on a nation, and that nation shall remain cursed; and likewise had the ability to bless a nation, and have it remain blessed.</p>
		  	<p>Having the knowledge, that he had the ability to curse and bless any nation was not enough justification for him to fulfil the request of Balak. He had to enquire of the Lord what to do.</p>
		  	<p>When he took the proposal to God, God restrained him from cursing them, because they are the blessed of God. We need to understand what the will of God is, before we dare to act.</p>
		  	<p>Before Balaam could consider the proposal of Balak, he had to hear from God. Not many of us will respond that way.</p>
		  	<p>Many of us take advantage of anything that we have the ability to do, without realizing that having the ability to do something is not enough reason to do it. God’s approval is what makes everything worth doing.</p>
		  	<p>Without the approval and presence of God in everything, we remain vulnerable. We need to imbibe the habit of acknowledging the Lord in everything.</p>
		  	<p>Don’t go ahead to curse a nation because you know you can. Don’t go ahead to start a project because you know you’re capable. Don’t honor invitations because they seem like opportunities. Enquire of the Lord!</p>
		  	<p>As long as you’re led by Holy Spirit, and your steps are continually ordered by God, you are sure to soar on heights greater than all that has ever been attained. Be blessed!</p>
