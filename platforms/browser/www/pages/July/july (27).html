		  	<p><i>For when they shall say, Peace and safety; then sudden destruction cometh upon them, as travail upon a woman with child; and they shall not escape. (1 Thessalonians 5:3)</i></p>


		  	<blockquote>There is no man, whose constant dwelling is in the presence of God, that harbors the fear of evil and plague. </blockquote>

		  	<p>Sometime ago, I was asked about my background, so I spoke about the city I was born and bred in, and I mentioned that my family still resides in that city. The city happens to be known for the crises that had previously occurred in it, and the terrorist attacks that have covered its borders.</p>
		  	<p>Due to past occurrences, it is not regarded as a safe city; this is the city of Jos, Nigeria.</p>
		  	<p>As soon as I made mention of that city, the person, who questioned my background responded, “Why don’t your family consider relocation, to a safe city”, to his response, I boldly stated, “There is no safe city.”</p>
		  	<p>Verily, there is no earthly city that is developed enough to guarantee your safety. Many people have fallen victims to ill circumstances, even in cities that are well established.</p>
		  	<p>The Boston marathon blast of 2013 claimed the lives of some innocent fellows, and left some injured; innocent kids were gunned down at Connecticut, United States, by an unknown gun man. Many eventually felt relieved to know that the government of US did not rest until the perpetrators were brought to book.</p>
		  	<p>This is just to mention few recent occurrences; many residents of different cities, including developed ones, wake up in the morning, but become victims of ill circumstances before the end of the day.</p>
		  	<p>Think about how terrorist attacks occur; it’s just as the scripture has stated; sometimes, we resort to thinking that there is peace, and we are all safe in our city, but suddenly, the unexpected happens.</p>
		  	<p>Verily, some earthly cities are more developed than others; some are safer to dwell in than others; but none can give you a hundred percent guarantee of your safety. It is good that we work together to ensure that we make the society a better place to live in.</p>
		  	<p>However, we must realize that safety is guaranteed somewhere; it is not in any city, but in the name of the Lord. It is written:</p>
		  	<p><i>The name of the Lord is a strong tower: the righteous runneth into it, and is safe (Proverbs 18:10)</i></p>
		  	<p>Where can a man relocate to and be safe? Where can a man run to and find rest? The name of the Lord is that tower. Everyone, who decides not to rely on the development of his city, but calls on the name of the Lord, will be safe.</p>
		  	<p>The Israelites majestically walked through the red sea that consumed the Egyptians. How? They called on the name of the Lord. The sea is not such a safe place to walk through, but as long as you are covered by a strong tower—the name of the Lord, you’re alright. It is written:</p>
		  	<p><i>Because thou hast made the LORD, which is my refuge, even the most High, thy habitation;</i></p>
		  	<p><i>There shall no evil befall thee, neither shall any plague come nigh thy dwelling. (Psalms 91:9-10)</i></p>
		  	<p>As the scripture rightly states, the only guarantee that evil will not befall you, is in making the Most High your refuge and habitation.</p>
		  	<p>There is no man, whose constant dwelling is in the presence of God, that harbors the fear of evil and plague.</p>
		  	<p>Evil and plague can come nigh the dwelling of anyone, even those in developed cities, but as long as the Lord remains your refuge and habitation, it is impossible for evil to befall you.</p>
		  	<p>Here’s the point, you can be in safety without necessarily dwelling in a safe city. As long as you are in the Lord, your safety is certain.</p>
		  	<p>It is obvious that there is no safe city, but God’s realm of Life. No matter how safe or unsafe your city is regarded, if the Lord is your habitation, and you dwell in God’s realm of Life, your security is sure.</p>
