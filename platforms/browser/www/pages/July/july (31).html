		  	<p><i>The Sovereign LORD is my strength; he makes my feet like the feet of a deer, he enables me to tread on the heights</i></p>
		  	<p><i>For the director of music. On my stringed instruments. (Habakkuk 3:19)</i></p>

		  	<blockquote>To do the extra-ordinary, you need to see beyond the boundaries of human possibilities. </blockquote>

		  	<p>Many men have walked on the surface of the earth; the indelible footprints of some are still leading others to great places, while the footprints of some others, were wiped away and covered shortly after their demise.</p>
		  	<p>Each new day, unveils the level of a new height attained; some men have set a record, and others have broken it; but the initial record setters can never be forgotten.</p>
		  	<p>There was a first man to walk on the moon — Neil Armstrong; perhaps some others walked on it after him, but the first can never be forgotten.</p>
		  	<p>There was a first man to go into space — Yuri Gagarin; many others might have gone into space after him, but he cannot be forgotten. He was the first!</p>
		  	<p>Mount Everest might have been climbed by many people over the years, but the first group of people, Tenzing Norgay and Edmund Hillary, can never be forgotten.</p>
		  	<p>There is something about being the first to attain a certain height;</p>
		  	<p>Walking on the moon might have been tagged an impossibility, until someone did it; going into space was impossible, until someone made it possible; Mount Everest was an unattainable height, until the duo attained it.</p>
		  	<p>In being the first to attain a certain height, you are not only celebrated as the first, but the way-maker; because your achievement opens up the doors for people after you to excel. Your achievement is what redefines possibilities.</p>
		  	<p>Beloved, as the scripture rightly states, God has divinely enabled us to soar on heights that men have never reached. Stop setting your target on heights that have already been attained; don’t have a myopic view; look beyond the possible.</p>
		  	<p>If Neil Armstrong was only thinking about possibilities, he never would have attempted a walk on the moon; beloved, to do the extra-ordinary, you need to see beyond the boundaries of human possibilities.</p>
		  	<p>If the Lord is our source of strength, then there is no height we cannot attain.</p>
		  	<p>Today, position your mind to achieve greater things! Don’t be focused on just living an average life. Don’t be comfortable with the height you are treading on, for there is something higher than that.</p>
		  	<p>Why should I set my target on the sky, when there are footprints on the moon?</p>
		  	<p>We have been blessed and divinely enabled to soar on heights that men have never reached; set your mind on attaining the unattainable. The Lord is your strength. Be blessed!</p>
