		  	<p><i>And the Angel of the Lord said to him, Why have you struck your donkey these three times? See, I came out to stand against and resist you, for your behavior is willfully obstinate and contrary before Me.</i></p>
		  	<p><i>And the ass saw Me and turned from Me these three times. If she had not turned from Me, surely I would have slain you and saved her alive. (Numbers 22:32-33)</i></p>

		  	<blockquote>The doors will not remain shut if it were not for your good. </blockquote>

		  	<p>Ever wondered why things don’t always happen the way you want it to? Are there seasons when you put in efforts to make opportunities open up, but the doors just seem to be resisting your push?</p>
		  	<p>At times when situations seem to be acting against us, what we should understand is that all things work together for our good. The doors will not remain shut if it were not for your good.</p>
		  	<p>Balaam had a donkey that had served him diligently all through the years, but there was a certain trip which he embarked on, which revealed the insurgent aspect of the donkey.</p>
		  	<p>During the trip, the donkey suddenly stopped responding to his commands; when he wanted it to move, it stopped; when he wanted it to be upright, it sat; when he forced the donkey, it spoke up</p>
		  	<p>There had to be a reason why the donkey was suddenly rebellious, and that reason was for good. The Angel of the Lord said, <i>If she had not turned from Me, surely I would have slain you and saved her alive.</i></p>
		  	<p>Verily, if the donkey had not been rebellious Balaam would have been slayed by the Angel of the Lord. It is important to note that the Donkey wouldn’t have been hurt if it obeyed Balaam, but for Balaam’s sake, the donkey embraced insurgency.</p>
		  	<p>Can’t you see that the reason why your vehicle will not move no matter how much force you apply is for your good? The reason why that contract was not gotten, despite your efforts, may be for your own good.</p>
		  	<p>Beloved, your destiny is too important for you to try to force yourself to a direction contrary to God’s will.</p>
		  	<p>If Balaam understood that all things work together for good, he would have accepted the insurgency of the ass in good faith. Stop struggling to make things work out your own way; stop struggling to make your ass obey you.</p>
		  	<p>Everything happens for a purpose; when your ass is not moving, that might just be a warning that you’re on the wrong track; don’t force things to go in a direction that you have not confirmed.</p>
		  	<p>Balaam was struggling to make his ass move, without confirming that the direction was of God. Beloved, before you begin to force your vehicle to move, be sure that you’re going in the right direction.</p>
		  	<p>When you’re in the right direction, you will not need to struggle to make your vehicle move; you will produce sweatless results. There is no event that occurs in the life of a believer, which does not work out for his good. Be blessed!</p>
