		  	<p><i>Therefore let no man glory in men. For all things are your’s;(1 Corinthians 3:21)</i></p>
		  	

		  	<blockquote>Nothing remains out of your reach when you get to that point of knowledge.</blockquote>

		  	<p>I have realized something among many Christians of this age; this realization of mine is very true, as a result of nothing other than lack of knowledge (ignorance). Here’s what I observed—most of the things we endlessly struggle to achieve or attain are ours’ already.</p>
		  	<p>Interestingly, Paul states in this scripture that all things are ours. He didn’t say that all things will be ours’. No! If that was what he said, we would have every reason to think that it is a mere assurance or encouragement.</p>
		  	<p>In saying that all things are ours’ already, it is implied that in reality, we have all things already. This is not mere hope, but reality! Stop struggling to earn things that are yours’ already.</p>
		  	<p>Furthermore, notice, He did not say “some things are ours’”, but “all things ...” All things mean everything! Not a single thing exists, which is not yours’ to freely possess.</p>
		  	<p>There is one hindrance to handling that which is already yours’, and that’s lack of knowledge. When something is yours’ and you don’t know it, you won’t be able to claim or possess it.</p>
		  	<p>Take a look at the parable of the prodigal son. When he had acted in and out of folly, his Father received him back and held a feast for him; but his elder brother was jealous because such a feast was never held for him, despite his efforts to stay out of folly. Here’s what the Father said to him:</p>
		  	<p><i>And he said unto him, Son, thou art ever with me, and all that I have is thine. (Luke 15:31)</i></p>
		  	<p>By this, he made it clear that all His possessions has always belonged to him; perhaps the elder son never knew it until then, and that’s why he got saddened. Until you realize what is yours in Christ, you will be easily depressed.</p>
		  	<p>Just like the Father said to his son, God has said to us, that all things are ours’ already. You don’t need to compromise to achieve anything; you only need sound knowledge of God’s Word, to understand that all things are yours’ already.</p>
		  	<p>The devil tempted Jesus, but Jesus overcame him with a sound knowledge of the Word. He tried to lure Jesus to bow and worship him in order to receive all treasures of the earth; but Jesus understood that he did not need to compromise or bow, in order to possess that, which is His own already.</p>
		  	<p>People become members of fraternities in order to boost their financial status and reputation, and in some cases, gain protection as well. If only they knew that wealth and protection is theirs already, they wouldn’t sell their souls to get it.</p>
		  	<p>Why pay a price to obtain that which is yours already? All you need is a sound knowledge of God’s Word, yielding faith, with which you can obtain all that is yours’ already.</p>
		  	<p>That position is yours if you know it; promotion is yours if you know it. Nothing remains out of your reach when you get to that point of knowledge. It is yours’ already, only receive it in faith. Be blessed!</p>
