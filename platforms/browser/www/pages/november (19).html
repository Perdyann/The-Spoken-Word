		  <div class="panel-body" style="text-align:justify">


		  	<p><i>Praying always with all prayer and supplication in the Spirit, and watching thereunto with all perseverance and supplication for all saints; (Ephesians 6:18)</i></p>
		  

		  	<blockquote>Having done all to be equipped in the full armour of God, persevere in all prayers and supplications.</blockquote>

		  	<p>Just after we are admonished to put on the whole armour of God, this scripture is released. All that we have done to be well equipped in the full armor of God is only summed up by our perseverance in prayers.</p>
		  	<p>There’s no point putting on the armour today and taking it off tomorrow; in that case, you’d be a worse prey than you were before.</p>
		  	<p>After you must have laid a foundation of truth, put on the breastplate of righteousness, shared the Gospel of peace, held on to your shield of faith, put on your helmet of salvation and held the sword of the Spirit, which is the Word of God, it might seem like it’s over, but it is not.</p>
		  	<p>This needs to be backed up with fervent prayers, and perseverance. To remain on top of your game, you must persevere in prayers. You cannot decide to share the gospel of peace today, and then retire tomorrow; you cannot decide to feed on the Word today, and then dump it tomorrow.</p>
		  	<p>Great men, who produced effective results in their Ministry and affairs, are those, who persevered in prayers. When you begin a race, start with a goal of crossing the finish-line, and not just quitting half-way.</p>
		  	<p>We have an understanding that the weapons of warfare are not carnal, but mighty to the pulling down of strongholds. Beloved, having done all to be equipped in the full armour of God, persevere in all prayers and supplications.</p>
		  	<p>So often, we must have heard the saying, “a prayerless man is a powerless man” How true! Life is spiritual; that, which cannot be achieved by our human efforts in the natural realm, can easily be sorted in the spiritual realm, through prayers.</p>
		  	<p>Need I emphasize the importance of perseverance in prayer?</p>
		  	<p>t is written, <i> “Pray without ceasing (1 Thessalonians 5:17).”</i> Some versions give renditions such as: pray perseveringly; never stop praying; Prayer has no season; as long as it is effective, it works just fine.</p>
		  	<p>When you pray constantly in the Spirit, your senses are quickened to perceive spiritual mysteries, and control earthly affairs, from your spiritual position.</p>
		  	<p>Meditate constantly on the Word of God, declare Rhema, and pray in the Spirit at all times. Be blessed!</p>
