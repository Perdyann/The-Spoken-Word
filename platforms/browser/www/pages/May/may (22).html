		  	<p><i>Turn my eyes from looking at worthless things; and give me life in your ways. (Psalms 119:37 ESV)</i></p>

		  	<blockquote>Your assignment is too great, and your future is too bright to allow worthless things steal your attention, and cause you to derail or lose focus. </blockquote>

		  	<p>It is obvious that the Psalmist must have understood the harm of feeding his senses with worthless things. Thus, of all things he deemed right to speak to God about; he prayed that God turns his eyes away from worthless things.</p>
		  	<p>When you deliberately cling on to worthless things, you will not be able to live out that perfect life God has orchestrated for you.</p>
		  	<p>Sometimes, before you get involved in anything, you need to measure its worth. If it will not add any value to your life, if it will not edify and if it does not improve your mindset, then it is obviously trash. Get rid of it!</p>
		  	<p>Not everything deserves your attention. Paying too much attention to worthless stuffs gradually drains you of any bit of value left within you. When you have spent more time in life, in front of the TV screen, than you have spent in God’s presence; what kind of mindset do you think you’d have?</p>
		  	<p>You cannot be receiving the trash everyone has to dump in your mind, and be receiving God’s Divine Word at the same time. In order for you to move to your next level in life, you need to get rid of every trash occupying free space in your mind or life; they’re not as important as you deem them.</p>
		  	<p>There is a particular information channel I tuned into everyday. Just one day, I began to think—since I have been watching this channel, what value has it added to my life? In what way has it influenced my thinking?—In no time, I realized that it was worthless; verily, it had done my mind more harm than good.</p>
		  	<p>Beloved, I admonish you today to get rid of worthless things. Your mind is not a bin to contain trash; it was carefully designed by God to contain valuable information, and harbor visions that will help you achieve your purpose, and reach your destiny in life. It is written:</p>
		  	<p><i>A wise person is hungry for knowledge, while the fool feeds on trash. (Proverbs 15:14 NLT)</i></p>
		  	<p>Be wise! Knowing that some things are worthless and still clinging unto them is not different from feeding on trash. Rather than devote your attention, time and resources to worthless things, be wise and feed on knowledge.</p>
		  	<p>You are what you feed on. When you feed on worthless stuff, you will become worthless in no time; however, feeding on God’s Word stretches your potentials and makes you extra-ordinary.</p>
		  	<p>The knowledge of worthless things of the world is junk; but the Knowledge of God’s Word is irreplaceable. If you can transfer the time and attention you previously spent on trash, and devote it to feeding your Spirit with Divine Knowledge, your greatness will know no boundaries.</p>
		  	<p>Your assignment is too great, and your future is too bright to allow worthless things steal your attention, and cause you to derail or lose focus.</p>
		  	<p>Water is valuable, and fuel as well, but putting water in a car and drinking fuel is disastrous. Some things are not necessarily worthless or bad, but are not suitable for you in some certain seasons. To get the best out of anything, it must be used rightly. The internet is good, but when misused, it does more harm than good. Therefore, it must be used rightly. Rather than use it to satisfy the desires of your flesh, use it to share the gospel.</p>
		  	<p>Time is one of the greatest things God has given man. Your time is too valuable to give out just anyhow. Rather than wasting time on worthless stuffs, invest your time in valuable things. Be blessed!</p>
