		  	<p><i>for while bodily training is of some value, godliness is of value in every way, as it holds promise for the present life and also for the life to come. (1Timothy 4:8 ESV)</i></p>


		  	<blockquote>Godliness restricts your thinking, action and speech within the confinement of God’s Word.</blockquote>

		  	<p>This is so amazing; Paul did not deny that bodily exercise is valuable, but gave light to the truth that the value of bodily exercise is nothing to be compared with the value of godliness.</p>
		  	<p>In some versions the word profit is used in place of value.</p>
		  	<p>He justified his stand by implying that unlike godliness, the value of bodily exercise is not unto all things. In essence, bodily exercise is profitable in some ways, but not in everything. However, godliness is profitable in everything.</p>
		  	<p>Bodily training might keep you fit on earth, but I believe fitness is not all we need. If a survey were to be taken, and each man was to list his needs according to its priority (scale of preference), I believe fitness will not top the list of many people.</p>
		  	<p>As much as we desire to be fit by bodily exercise and training, we must admit that it is not our most essential need.</p>
		  	<p>The value of fitness cannot be denied, but it’s nothing comparable to the value of godliness. What is godliness?</p>
		  	<p>It is having great reverence for God; devotion to God in all commitment and love. When it is said, “you were bought with a price” (1 Corinthians 6:20 & 7:23), many people don’t really read in-between the lines, and thus they develop a misconception of that passage. Don’t live like you own yourself; be sold out to God.</p>
		  	<p>There are some certain things you will not do when you understand that you were bought with a price; godliness restricts your thinking, action and speech within the confinement of God’s Word.</p>
		  	<p>When you are sold out to God, you live life, not of your own will and accord, but to fulfil your God-given purpose. In essence, godliness constantly shapes and guides you towards the fulfillment of purpose; it awakens you to the reality of your divine nature.</p>
		  	<p>There are places a godly man will not go, things he will not say, and actions he will not perform, simply because it defies his nature.</p>
		  	<p>In such a world as we are, bodily training might seem more convenient to perform, but it is not of much value as compared to godliness. Godliness pays!</p>
		  	<p>Unlike bodily training, the value of godliness lasts in the present life, and the life to come. Quite a lot of people think that the reward for serving God is only received in the life to come, after the earth has passed away.</p>
		  	<p>It is amazing to comprehend that godliness is also profitable in our present life.</p>
		  	<p>Being born-again, we’ve received God’s Kind of Life; a life without failure, sickness, poverty, and bondage . . . The value of that kind of Life commences in this life, and not the life after.</p>
		  	<p>The only thing that rips believers of the profit of godliness in this life is ignorance. No matter how godly you are, if you are unaware of the promises godliness holds for you in this present life, you cannot profit from it. Godliness is of value in every way. Be blessed!</p>
