		  	<p><i>My sheep hear my voice, and I know them, and they follow me: (John 10:27)</i></p>
		 


		  	<blockquote>More than you desire to hear God, God desires to have your attention. You cannot hear Him without being attentive. </blockquote>

		  	<p>In the opinion of some, hearing God is not quite necessary; they believe in just doing that thing which they deem right; some others believe that no one can hear God; and those who claim to hear are just making it up;again, to some others, hearing God is their desire; they really want to hear, but just can’t.</p>
		  	<p>However, the importance of hearing God is unarguable; this particular scripture likens it to the relationship between the sheep and the shepherd. And to think of it, how can the sheep be directed by a shepherd, whose voice they cannot hear?</p>
		  	<p>We all want our steps to be ordered by the Lord; we all want to be led and directed by the Holy Spirit; but do we really care about hearing God? What most people fail to realize is that they cannot be directed by He, whom they cannot hear.</p>
		  	<p>For the Lord to order your steps to high places in life, you need to hear Him clearly in every season.</p>
		  	<p>Quite a number of people have spoken to me about their states of dilemma; in most cases I have asked, “What is the Lord saying about it”, and most of them have outrightly stated their inability to hear God.</p>
		  	<p>They are in an important season of their lives, when an important decision is to be made, but they find it very difficult to receive direction from God, because they cannot hear for themselves, what the Lord is saying.</p>
		  	<p>It is not enough that you seek advice from a counselor; it is not enough that you receive direction from your mentor; it is not enough that you always need your Pastor to translate to you, what the Lord is saying. God wants you to be able to hear Him for yourself</p>
		  	<p>The least Christian should be able to hear the voice of God. As long as you are His sheep; there is no reason why you should not be able to hear God. It is written:</p>
		  	<p><i>Whoever is of God hears the words of God. The reason why you do not hear them is that you are not of God.” (John 8:47 ESV)</i></p>
		  	<p>Verily, as long as you are of God, you should hear the His voice. The reason why you still don’t hear is obviously because you have misplaced priorities.</p>
		  	<p>It’s been months since you last had a personal bible study; you hardly pray in the Holy Ghost; you hardly devote quality time to God.</p>
		  	<p>The highest time some people ever devote to God daily is five minutes, and they proudly go ahead saying, “It’s not about the length of prayer but its effectiveness.” And I keep wondering how effective a five minutes prayer can be for a day.</p>
		  	<p>You want to hear God, but you’re not willing to spend time listening to Him. More than you desire to hear God, God desires to have your attention. You cannot hear Him without being attentive.</p>
		  	<p>When you get it in your nature to be devoted to God in everything, it will be impossible for you to say that you cannot hear Him.</p>
		  	<p>When a sheep strays far away, it will no longer be able to hear the voice of the shepherd because of how far it has gone. Likewise, when you derail, and stray, you might not be able hear in clarity.</p>
		  	<p>Whenever you stop hearing God, you become to prone to mistakes and the traps of the enemy. In ministry, in academics, in general affairs, and at every season, be sure to hear God.</p>
		  	<p>There are destiny killers, who are prepared to ruin your affairs, ministry, family and business; these fellows might come with enticing and polished looking opportunities that seem like an open door; if you cannot discern the voice of God, you might get caught up in their traps.</p>
		  	<p>Be careful the ideas you receive in your ministry and affairs; some traps come in form of opportunities. However, if you constantly hear God, and obey, it will be impossible to get trapped. Hear God in every season. Be blessed!</p>
