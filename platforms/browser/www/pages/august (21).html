		  	<p><i>Consider the lilies how they grow: they toil not, they spin not; and yet I say unto you, that Solomon in all his glory was not arrayed like one of these.</i></p>
		  	<p><i>If then God so clothe the grass, which is to day in the field, and to morrow is cast into the oven; how much more will he clothe you, O ye of little faith? (Luke 12:27-28)</i></p>


		  	<blockquote>Even if you can’t trust your future, trust the one who holds it.</blockquote>

		  	<p>The bible describe Solomon as the wisest, wealthiest, and the most influential man of his time. His dressing must have befitted his royal status, portrayed glory, and been outstanding.</p>
		  	<p>However, the height of his glamour is nothing compared to the beauty of the lilies. The lilies don’t toil or work, but God beautifies them daily; the grass, although not so valuable, is always nurtured.</p>
		  	<p>If God cares so much for the lilies that toil not, the grass that withers away, and the birds that labor not; how much more will He care for you, whom He has created in His own image, to be a reflection of His glory on the earth?</p>
		  	<p>Despite Solomon’s effort to look good as a king should, he was still not as beautifully arrayed as the lilies were. Verily, beauty is not as a result of efforts put in, but blessings released.</p>
		  	<p>It is obvious that anxiety and worry are not capable of adding value to you; the pursuit of earthly gains cannot beautify a man; your endless toil only drains your strength, without replenishing you.</p>
		  	<p>Your toil will not clothe you as well as the Lord will; worry will not provide for you as well as praise will.</p>
		  	<p>If the criteria for obtaining beauty were effort, the lilies would have been an eyesore, because they never toiled. However, that isn’t the case; the Lord gave beauty to the lilies, even more than those who had put in effort to look beautiful.</p>
		  	<p>Here’s the point, if the Lord will care that much for the lilies and grasses that will eventually wither away in no time, how much more, we, who have received Eternal life?</p>
		  	<p>Everything about you matters so much to God — your look, job, health, safety and prosperity — Why then should you be anxious about these things?</p>
		  	<p>If God clothes the lilies, how much more will He clothe you? If He caters for the birds of the air, how much more will He cater for your needs? If He cares so much for the grass that withers, then He must care much more for you!</p>
		  	<p>Much more than your affairs matter to you, they matter to God. Rely on this Word today; God will do to you, what He’s never done for anyone before. Even if you can’t trust your future, trust the one who holds it. Be blessed!</p>
