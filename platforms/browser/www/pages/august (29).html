		  	<p><i>And he trembling and astonished said, Lord, what wilt thou have me to do? And the Lord said unto him, Arise, and go into the city, and it shall be told thee what thou must do.</i></p>
		  	<p><i>And straightway he preached Christ in the synagogues, that he is the Son of God. (Acts 9:6&20)</i></p>

		  	<blockquote>Many lessons have I learnt and forgotten, but time is not enough to fade away that, which was learnt through an encounter.</blockquote>

		  	<p>Sometimes, it takes an encounter for us to be transformed; no amount of preaching, sermons, prayers and fasting could transform Saul as much as his encounter with Jesus did.</p>
		  	<p>It is amazing to comprehend that Saul was on a mission to persecute the Christians, but by a single encounter in the process, his mission was re-defined. </p>
		  	<p>As soon as Saul recovered from the encounter, he did not need to attend a seminary school to gain any theological knowledge; he did not need to attend discipleship class to be qualified for an ordination; but straightway, he preached.</p>
		  	<p>How amazing! It did not take him decades after the encounter, in order to be released to preach the Gospel of Christ. He started preaching immediately! Three days encounter was enough to give him the revelation he needed.</p>
		  	<p>Considering the extent of Saulâ€™s hard heartiness, I am quite certain that only a personal encounter with Christ was capable of transforming him.</p>
		  	<p>I have met people with hard hearts before; people who will not tolerate hearing the name of Jesus for a second; even so, I am convinced that if God could transform Saul, then no heart is too hard for God to penetrate.</p>
		  	<p>Encounter is powerful; much more than I can try to persuade an unbeliever to trust God, I pray for an encounter. An encounter is enough to teach in three days, what ordinarily will take three years to learn. An encounter is enough to melt a heart that was too hard to access.</p>
		  	<p>Many lessons have I learnt and forgotten, but time is not enough to fade away that, which was learnt through an encounter. No matter how much the surface is wiped, the initial print of an encounter remains for a life-time.</p>
		  	<p>No man encounters Christ and remains the same. There is nothing as revealing, awesome and great as an encounter with the Lord; have you really encountered Christ?</p>
		  	<p>Spare a moment today to intercede for the lost; let God give them an encounter that will transform. Be blessed!</p>
