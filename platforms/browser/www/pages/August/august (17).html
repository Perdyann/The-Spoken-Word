		  	<p><i>Against all hope, Abraham in hope believed and so became the father of many nations, just as it had been said to him, “So shall your offspring be.” (Romans 4:18)</i></p>

		  	<blockquote>Great men are known for attaining impossible goals; if the goal was possible initially, then there’s nothing special about its attainment.</blockquote>

		  	<p>Abraham believed in hope against hope. Despite the hopelessness of the situation, Abraham chose to believe. How well can you believe God when situations are humanly hopeless and impossible?</p>
		  	<p>Men who defied the course of human nature are those who held unto hope against all hope.</p>
		  	<p>Abraham, becoming the Father of one, not to think of an entire nation, was a situation too impossible and hopeless to consider. At that season of his life, his least focus was having a child; that was probably an issue he wrote-off previously.</p>
		  	<p>However, when God gave him a Word, despite how infeasible it seemed, he still believed. His ability to hope against hope gave way for the promise to be manifested.</p>
		  	<p>Has the Lord given you a Word that seems impossible? Looking at your present situation, that Word might seem hopeless; you are fully aware that humanly, it is not possible.</p>
		  	<p>Will you sit down with folded arms and admit the impossibility of the manifestation of God’s Word over your life? Will you quit trying because of the hopelessness of the situation? Or will you choose to believe in hope, even against hope?</p>
		  	<p>The latter is the attitude that ushers you into your promise in no season. If you choose to weigh situations based on their level of possibility, then you’d never achieve anything great. Great men are known for attaining impossible goals; if the goal was possible initially, then there’s nothing special about its attainment.</p>
		  	<p>For you reach your destiny in life, you have to move with an attitude of faith; such that translates hopelessness to fruitfulness.</p>
		  	<p>It’s amazing to comprehend that after all the years of dreaming and torture, Joseph was eventually promoted to a royal position. This was a hopeless situation initially because, from the perspective of his jealous brothers, he was only a little boy with an oversized vision.</p>
		  	<p>Goliath’s defeat was quite a hopeless situation, considering the fact that David was only a youth. However, because of David’s hope against all hope, it translated to being a reality.</p>
		  	<p>Believing in God, even against hope, breaks protocols, limitations and barriers; thereby, paving the path to your greatness. No matter how hopeless the situation seems, believe. Be blessed!</p>
