		  	<p><i>And Jesus stood still, and commanded him to be called. And they call the blind man, saying unto him, Be of good comfort, rise; he calleth thee.</i></p>
		  	<p><i>And he, casting away his garment, rose, and came to Jesus. (Mark 10:49-50)</i></p>

		  	<blockquote>Until you consciously put away your old garment, you can never step into your next level of glory.</blockquote>

		  	<p>For quite a while, Bartimaeus was known for his situation of being blind, and begging on the high way. For so long, he had put on a garment of shame, infirmity and pain.</p>
		  	<p>Just one day, as Jesus passed by, He could not but notice this blind man, who called upon Him with a loud voice, not seeming to mind his environment and its protocols. Jesus commanded him to be called.</p>
		  	<p>The first action of Bartimaeus when he heard the call of Jesus is very significant. ‘And he, casting away his garment, rose’ before he could rise up to meet the master, he had to cast away his garment of old.</p>
		  	<p>Likewise beloved, you cannot rise higher without casting away the garments of old. Until you consciously put away your old garment, you can never step into your next level of glory.</p>
		  	<p>His old garment represents his past, but the new garment of healing, which he was to receive from Jesus, represents his future. You need to understand that your future is more important than your past.</p>
		  	<p>Where you are going to is more significant than where you are coming from. Therefore, the last thing you should ever think of doing, is stepping into a new season with the garment of the old season.</p>
		  	<p>I recall when my sister was getting married; one of the things she did was to get rid of her old garments, and purchase new ones. She realized that she was stepping into a new season of her life, and she could not afford to carry on with the garments of old.</p>
		  	<p>Beloved, you need to have the ability to recognize when your garment gets too old for your season; don’t try to patch it up, don’t try to manage it, cast it away!</p>
		  	<p>Even Bartimaeus realized that his encounter with Jesus was to mark a new era of his life, and wipe out the eradication of shame. Therefore, he couldn’t attempt littering the new era of health, with the same old garment of infirmity.</p>
		  	<p>Isn’t it obvious that until you cast away the old garment, you can never receive anything new? The reason why you might not have been able to step higher in life, no matter how hard you tried, is probably because you have refused to let go of your old garments.</p>
		  	<p>You cannot step into your future with the same old habits; you cannot step into a new season with the same old mindset; you cannot soar on eagle’s height, with chicken wings. To go further in life, there’d have to come a time when you will deliberately cast off your old garments. It is written:</p>
		  	<p><i>No man putteth a piece of new cloth unto an old garment, for that which is put in to fill it up taketh from the garment, and the rent is made worse. (Matthew 9:16)</i></p>
		  	<p>Verily, when we try to blend our old lifestyle with the new, we get the worst result. If you want to go forward, ensure you destroy everything that pulls you backward.</p>
		  	<p>You cannot open a new chapter of your life, when you keep revisiting old chapters; drop the old garment, and go get something new. Be blessed!</p>
