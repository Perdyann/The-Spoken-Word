		  	<p><i>Therefore whosoever heareth these sayings of mine, and doeth them, I will liken him unto a wise man, which built his house upon a rock:</i></p>
		  	<p><i>And the rain descended, and the floods came, and the winds blew, and beat upon that house; and it fell not: for it was founded upon a rock. (Matthew 7:24-25)</i></p>
		  	<p><i></i></p>

		  	<blockquote>The final result of any building, after a test, depends on the strength of the foundation. </blockquote>

		  	<p>There is a foundation that is capable of preserving a house, despite all odds. In this passage, we are made to understand that when all terrible disasters were let loose upon a house, that house stood still, for no other reason, than the foundation. Indeed, some foundations have the capacity to preserve.</p>
		  	<p>I am quite sure that if such rain, floods and winds were channelled towards another house, which was probably founded on sinking sand, the house will by no means stand. The final result of any building, after a test, depends on the strength of the foundation.</p>
		  	<p>Beloved, just like these houses, so are we. At every phase of a man’s life, there is a new test and trial. Just when we think that we’ve overcome the most pressing trials of our lives, we are being launched into another phase of trials. However, if the foundation is right, it has the capacity to preserve.</p>
		  	<p>Like I always say, “If you are building a house, and realise that you have started on a wrong foundation, demolish the building and start over, before it gets too late.” There is nothing that preserves a building like the foundation. It is written:</p>
		  	<p><i>If the foundations be destroyed, what can the righteous do? (Psalm 11:3)</i></p>
		  	<p>The confidence we have about the strength of our mansion, rests in its foundation.</p>
		  	<p>The prerequisite to having a strong foundation is clearly portrayed in the passage today. It says, <i>whosoever heareth these sayings of mine, and doeth them, I will liken him unto a wise man, which built his house upon a rock: </i> True wisdom begins by hearing the Word of God, and acting in obedience to it.</p>
		  	<p>Have you heard from God concerning your future? If God has not spoken to you about His plan for your life, it’s of no use that you just decide to venture into a field that seems right to you. It may be too late, before you realise that you have spent all your strength and resources, building on the wrong foundation.</p>
		  	<p>As Christians, do we really bother to know about the foundation of Christianity? Christians are followers of Christ. We should be after becoming more like the personality of Jesus (holiness, love, amongst others).</p>
		  	<p>On what foundation are you standing? Is your marriage, business, or academics founded on lies, bribery, and falsehood? Any foundation that contradicts the Word of God is merely sinking sand.</p>
		  	<p>Beloved, the rains will come; the winds will blow; the floods will arise; indeed, there will be trials to test the quality of foundation on which we stand.</p>
		  	<p>Don’t wait for the trials to take you back to the beginning after many years of growth. Start now to erect a structure on God’s Word. For when the foundation is strong, it preserves us against all odds. Be wise!</p>
