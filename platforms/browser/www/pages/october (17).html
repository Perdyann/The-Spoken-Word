		  	<p><i>Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who hath blessed us with all spiritual blessings in heavenly places in Christ: (Ephesians 1:3)</i></p>

		  	<blockquote>The blessing, although available, remains unprofitable until it is received in faith.</blockquote>

		  	<p>I love this scripture for two reasons—the use of past tense in qualifying our blessings in Christ. Notice, it is not quoted, “who will bless us ...”, but, “who hath blessed us.” This clearly portrays that we have been blessed already, with all spiritual blessings in heavenly places.</p>
		  	<p>We were not just blessed on the day we felt the manifestation; no! The manifestation only occurred the day we received the blessing, which was already given ages ago. We have been blessed already, but we need to receive every blessing in faith, before we can see the manifestation of it.</p>
		  	<p>Many cheques have been written in my name, but it was not until I went to the bank to cash them, that they became useful to me. Likewise, God has already made available, all the blessings that we need, but it is not until we stretch forth to receive them, that they are made manifest.</p>
		  	<p>As a born again man, receiving any virtue in life depends on you; God has fulfilled His Word by granting you every virtue. However, until you receive it in faith, it remains of no use to you.</p>
		  	<p>The other aspect of this scripture that blows me away is the use of the term ‘all’, in qualifying the degree of blessings, with which we have been blessed.</p>
		  	<p>There are different categories of blessings; what one man considers a blessing differs from the desires of others. The only thing one man may desire is financial blessing, on the other hand, the only desire of another man might be marital bliss.</p>
		  	<p>The use of the term all in this scripture encapsulates every category of blessings—spiritual, financial, economic, marital, academic, or political. We have been blessed in all areas already. The blessing, although available, remains unprofitable until it is received in faith.</p>
		  	<p>Seeing then that we have already been blessed in all areas, how then can we receive this in faith? Faith has no other source than the Word of God. When you meditate constantly on the Word of God, faith comes, and through that, we can confidently receive all blessings.</p>
		  	<p>Blessings are not earned by works; no! They are freely given, but received by faith. Rather than toiling to get blessed, obtain that, which has already been released to you. Be blessed!</p>
