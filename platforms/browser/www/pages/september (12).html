		  	<p><i>So they poured out for the men to eat. And it came to pass, as they were eating of the pottage, that they cried out, and said, O thou man of God, there is death in the pot. And they could not eat thereof.</i></p>
		  	<p><i>But he said, Then bring meal. And he cast it into the pot; and he said, Pour out for the people, that they may eat. And there was no harm in the pot. (2 Kings 4:40-41)</i></p>

		  	<blockquote>Don’t be shaped by a circumstance, which you were born to change.</blockquote>

		  	<p>Elisha’s servants had gone out to gather herbs, in order to prepare a meal; in their search, they found a wild vine and carelessly, without knowing what it was, mixed it with the herbs, and prepared a meal for the Prophets sons.</p>
		  	<p>That was a very careless action that could have been grievous, in as the wild vine was poisonous.</p>
		  	<p>However, it is important to note that when Elisha’s attention was called to the issue, he did not order them to throw away the porridge as I expected him to; instead, he added another ingredient to it, which nullified the effects of the poison.</p>
		  	<p>If I was in the position of Elisha, I’d probably throw away the entire meal; but no! Elisha simply dealt with the poison. Likewise, don’t give up on an issue, which you can deal with.</p>
		  	<p>Beloved, how often have we wasted things that we could have changed? How often have we buried talents that we could have explored? How often have we given up on situations that still had solutions?</p>
		  	<p>When your situation gets worse, don’t give up on it; do something to make it better. Don’t be shaped by a circumstance, which you were born to change. Don’t waste something that you can change.</p>
		  	<p>If Elisha could transform a poisoned meal, to a healthy tasty meal; then, there is no situation that is beyond transformation. The meal might seem poisonous now, but don’t get rid of it yet, just one more ingredient can restore it.</p>
		  	<p>Furthermore, it is important to note that after the servants had mixed up wrong ingredients (wild vine & herbs), to produce a poisonous meal; by adding another ingredient (flour), Elisha made the whole meal a healthy one. It is obvious that just one right addition can change many wrong combinations.</p>
		  	<p>For every poison, there is an antidote; just one act of love, can transform a situation of harm, hatred and danger.</p>
		  	<p>The only antidote to that poisonous mixture was a little flour; the antidote to your environment of hatred, pain, shame, harm, insecurity, captivity, and failure might be just one act of love.</p>
		  	<p>Where there is hatred, create an atmosphere of love; where there is war, embrace peace; where there is pain, usher in joy. Don’t accept the poisoned meal, when you can make it healthy; add something to make perfect, the entire mixture.</p>
		  	<p>You are the change the world has groaned for; do something to transform your world today. Be blessed!</p>
