		  <div class="panel-body" style="text-align:justify">


		  	<p><i>But there is a God in heaven that revealeth secrets, and maketh known to the king Nebuchadnezzar what shall be in the latter days. Thy dream, and the visions of thy head upon thy bed, are these; (Daniel 2:28)</i></p>
		

		  	<blockquote>Mysteries are not defined by what they are, but by he, who searches them.</blockquote>

		  	<p>There are mysteries in life, which we have tried so hard to fathom, yet could not comprehend. Such mysteries led us to the conclusion that God works in mysterious ways. Scripturally analyzing and balancing the Word of truth, we realize that such statements and thoughts are not of God.</p>
		  	<p>Life is mysterious to some, but God does not work in mysterious ways. The things which some consider as mysteries, others consider as revelations. It all depends on where a man stands in God.</p>
		  	<p>The deep mysteries that the magicians, enchanters and astrologers could not search, was revealed to Daniel by God. There is nothing that remains hidden when God is in charge.</p>
		  	<p>The ways of God might seem mysterious, but mystery that is revealed is no longer mystery. There is a height you attain in God, where he makes all things known to you; there is an extent you relate to Him, that he makes known His intentions to you; there is a realm you operate from in the spirit, where nothing remains hidden to you.</p>
		  	<p>Here’s the truth, to some, God is mysterious, but to others, a revealer of mysteries. It all depends on how each man relates with the Holy Spirit. What the Lord has shown me, some others still consider hidden.</p>
		  	<p>Mysteries are not defined by what they are, but by he, who searches them. When a situation is unsearchable to a man, he considers it a mystery; but to him, who has dissected that same situation, it is a revelation.</p>
		  	<p>With God, nothing is a mystery! There is no intention or Divine plan for your life, which God will keep hidden, even when you relate intimately with him.</p>
		  	<p>The relationship between God and the church is often compared to that between a groom and his bride. A loving groom will always reason together with his wife before making any decision, likewise, God reasons together with those who are sold out to Him.</p>
		  	<p>Interpretation of dreams might not be so tasking, but it takes a man of revelation to rightly narrate, and then interpret any dream.</p>
		  	<p>There were many astrologers, magicians and enchanters who could interpret dreams, but only one wise man, who could narrate dreams — Daniel. The world is not searching for mere interpreters, but narrators.</p>
		  	<p>You should be willing to go an extra-mile to make a revelation of what the world considers a mystery. Daniel could not do this without God; the key to unlocking deeper mysteries in life, is God.</p>
		  	<p>The world is a tough and rough place for some, but to those, whom the deep mysteries of the world have been revealed, it becomes a bed of roses. To overcome the world, you must have a Divine knowledge and revelation of the mysteries therein.</p>
		  	<p>Choose not to dwell in the realm of the ordinary, but to soar on the wings of revelation. Be blessed!</p>
