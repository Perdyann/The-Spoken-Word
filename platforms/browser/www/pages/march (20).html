		  	<p><i>Now write another decree in the king’s name in behalf of the Jews as seems best to you, and seal it with the king’s signet ring—for no document written in the king’s name and sealed with his ring can be revoked.” (Esther 8:8)</i></p>

		  	<blockquote>All we need to overcome, in tough times, is one Word from God. With a single RHEMA, we could make a sea out of our desert. </blockquote>

		  	<p>Some time ago, I needed to make an application, which I deemed important in that season. It was such an application, which was not granted to virtually everyone that applied for it. However, I decided to apply in faith, trusting God that protocols would be broken for my sake.</p>
		  	<p>After putting so much effort to ensure that the application was well written and presented, I got one of my colleagues to spare a day out of his busy schedules, and join me in prayers for it.</p>
		  	<p>Not long after our prayers, we received this very Word as Rhema!</p>
		  	<p>Beloved, it is one thing to pray, and hope for an answer, it is another thing to be assured by Rhema. That is, for your prayers to be backed up by a personalized insight of the Word of God.</p>
		  	<p>So often, I’ve prayed, and merely waited in anticipation of my granted request, and sometimes, it was not exactly what I hoped for. However, at some other times, during the course of prayers, I received a Rhema to back it up. At such times, I felt something, much deeper than an assurance, and indeed, my expectations were never cut short.</p>
		  	<p>This particular Rhema was much more than an assurance to me. No sooner had I sent my application, than I received a response in my favour.</p>
		  	<p>All we need to overcome, in tough times, is one Word from God. With a single RHEMA, we could make a sea out of our desert.</p>
		  	<p>If Esther could post her letter of decree by the horse, and have it granted to her... If I could post my letter of application in the post office, and have it granted to me... You also will be granted your request, as far as it is sealed in the name of Our King.</p>
		  	<p>Beloved, it says, <i> “no document written in the king’s name and sealed with his ring can be revoked.” </i> Indeed, no document sealed with the name of God can be revoked. The fact that I deliberately took a day off, to ensure that my document is sealed and sent in God’s name, was enough guarantee that my application is irrevocable.</p>
		  	<p><i>“ ... as seems best to you ...”</i></p>
		  	<p>More interestingly, it is important to know that Esther was told to write whatever seems best to her. In essence, we have the freedom to write decrees, applications, letters amongst others, as we please. Indeed, as long as it is sealed with a prayer of Faith in the name of Jesus, it becomes irrevocable!</p>
		  	<p>Verily, this quote was made by the king of that era. If a mere king (man), who is of flesh and blood, could have such power and influence, how much more Our Lord? If indeed, those letters became irrevocable because of the signet and name of the King, how much more an application which bears the name of God.</p>
		  	<p>Beloved, I am very moved to share this with you today. Whatsoever application you are about to make, now or in the time to come. Take time to pray, and place it in the hands of God. Seal it in the name of God, and be assured that it is not revocable by any man.</p>
		  	<p>Do you need a job, admission into an institution, funding, benefits, amongst others? Be sure to seal that application in the name of God, and be rest assured that it cannot be revoked by man. Indeed, no document, which has the Kings signet, is revocable. Be blessed!</p>
