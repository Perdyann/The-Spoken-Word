		  	<p><i>By faith Noah, being warned of God of things not seen as yet, moved with fear, prepared an ark to the saving of his house; by the which he condemned the world, and became heir of the righteousness which is by faith. (Hebrews 11:7)</i></p>
		


		  	<blockquote>It takes faith, not only to do the impossible, but to be the only one doing it.</blockquote>

		  	<p>There are a couple of important things to note about the faith of Noah; the very first thing is his ability to hear God at such an evil time, when all men had turned their back on God, and embraced the height of abominable deeds.</p>
		  	<p>At that time, everyone was too entangled in their sinful ways, that it was impossible for anyone to hear the voice of God; but Noah, being undefiled, still had enough time, concentration, attention and devotion to hear God in clarity, and to obey.</p>
		  	<p>Furthermore, he spent many decades building an ark on a dry land, knowing that it was going to rain heavily pretty soon. We can imagine how he must have been ridiculed by everyone else, majorly considering the fact that they were not even followers of God.</p>
		  	<p>People must have thought that he’s probably insane; he must have been mocked and called foolish.</p>
		  	<p>However, not minding what the world had to say, Noah continued to build an ark in faith. Most times, when we are mocked for our actions, we tend to refrain in shame; not many of us are willing to continue doing something that everyone else laughs at, no matter how right it is.</p>
		  	<p>We often feel the need of support; we all desire some form of support in any way; we need our family and friends to stand by us at all times, and encourage us to continue in steadfastness; without support, we might tend to get weary, and lose our passion or zeal.</p>
		  	<p>Noah is one who had no support whatsoever; no one really believed in the arc he was building; everyone thought it was a mere waste of time. But he continued in faith.</p>
		  	<p>He held on to the Word of God, even when it did not seem possible. He held on to the Word of God, even when he was the only one holding on to it. </p>
		  	<p>It takes faith, not only to do the impossible, but to be the only one doing it. Though the rain Noah spoke about tarried, it eventually came to be. The earth was wiped away, but as many as entered the ark, were saved.</p>
		  	<p>Beloved, here’s the point; you must be sure to hear God in every season; never get too entangled by the affairs of the world, that you lose your attention. If Noah was not sensitive, he would have missed out.</p>
		  	<p>Likewise, you need to be sensitive to the voice of the Spirit at every season. Always find out what the Lord is saying about every situation before you dare to act.</p>
		  	<p>In addition, hold on to the Word of God no matter what happens; always understand that though it tarries, it will surely come to pass. Never get weary of doing the right thing, even if you’re the only one doing it.</p>
		  	<p>You might not have the support of everyone else, but as long as that vision is of God, it cannot but survive . . . its success is certain!</p>
		  	<p>Beloved, what’s that Word the Lord has spoken to you in the past, which you turned your back on, as a result of lack of support? What is that assignment the Lord has given to you, which you have constantly procrastinated? Are you sensitive enough to know what the Lord is saying, or are you too entangled with the affairs of the world?</p>
		  	<p>It pays to hear God, and obey in Faith, against all odds. Be blessed!</p>
