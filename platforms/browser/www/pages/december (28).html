		  	<p><i>When Jesus heard these things, he marvelled at him, and turned him about, and said unto the people that followed him, I say unto you, I have not found so great faith, no, not in Israel. (Luke 7:9)</i></p>
		

		  	<blockquote>Great men don’t do things the usual way; they go beyond ordinary means to accomplish distinct goals.</blockquote>

		  	<p>When Jesus saw the Centurions faith, He was certain that He had never seen such degree of faith in Israel. What the centurion did was to set a new record of faith.</p>
		  	<p>Many had exhibited faith in different level and degrees, but the faith of the Centurion surpassed them all. Some had faith that their loved ones would be healed if Jesus visited them, but the Centurion had a greater level of faith, which made him to believe that Jesus did not need to visit for his servant to be healed.</p>
		  	<p>The Centurion was certainly confident that if Jesus only spoke, his servant would be healed. He set a record of faith that no one had ever attained. Concerning David, it is written:</p>
		  	<p><i>And the women answered one another as they played, and said, Saul hath slain his thousands, and David his ten thousands. (1 Samuel 18:7)</i></p>
		  	<p>David set a new record of victory. There had been many warriors before him, who were more qualified in statue and experience, but the degree of David’s victory overshadowed them all.</p>
		  	<p>Saul was a powerful King and warrior, who had defeated thousands, but when David was anointed, he did ten times greater things than Saul. He set a new record of victory!</p>
		  	<p>Beloved, I want to encourage you to go beyond what you are used to, and set a new record. Great men don’t do things the usual way; they go beyond ordinary means to accomplish distinct goals. In order to be outstanding, you’ve got to be a pace setter and a record breaker.</p>
		  	<p>David was not satisfied with the thousands that Saul had slain, thus, he broke that record by defeating ten thousands. The centurion was not satisfied with the usual level of faith displayed by everyone, thus, he set a new record of faith.</p>
		  	<p>Records are made to be broken and not celebrated. Much more than you celebrate the records set by those before you, be challenged to replace it with something greater.</p>
		  	<p>Whenever the centurion is spoken about, faith comes to my mind; whenever David is spoken about, victory is envisaged in my mind; whenever Joseph is spoken about, promotion comes to my mind; what should come to my mind when your name is mentioned?</p>
		  	<p>Get out of your comfort zone, maximize your potentials, do something you’ve never done before, set a new kingdom record. Be blessed!</p>
