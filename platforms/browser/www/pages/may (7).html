		  <div class="panel-body" style="text-align:justify">


		  	<p><i>No weapon that is formed against thee shall prosper; and every tongue that shall rise against thee in judgment thou shalt condemn. This is the heritage of the servants of the Lord, and their righteousness is of me, saith the Lord. (Isaiah 54:17)</i></p>


		  	<blockquote>Insecurity is a word that only binds those in the earthly realm; a man who is sold out to God’s perfect will is sure of security.</blockquote>

		  	<p>Over recent years, the rate of fear and insecurity has inclined dramatically. A lot of people have been ripped off their liberty. They are no longer free to carry on activities, which they deem fit for them.</p>
		  	<p>The plans of many have been aborted by economic, social and political factors. No matter how much people invest in patronizing the life insurance policy, there is a still a feeling of insecurity harbored deep within.</p>
		  	<p>Many have fallen victims to the evil orchestrations and schemes of the enemy; many have been condemned by the judgment of the wicked; many have been drowned and defeated by unexpected circumstances. All these have created a deep feeling of insecurity in the heart of man.</p>
		  	<p>However, in this Word, our heritage is clearly pronounced. As servants of the Lord, no weapon (evil) designed, planned and fashioned against you shall ever prosper. In essence, the plans harbored in the womb of the enemy shall be aborted, even before the due time of its delivery (manifestation). For your sake, the Lord has given your enemies a miscarrying womb. It is impossible for evil to befall you!</p>
		  	<p>Furthermore, we are assured that the voices of the wicked, speaking judgment against us shall be condemned. Any voice speaking against your life, which is contrary to God’s voice, shall be silenced. In essence, only the Spoken Words of God over your life shall be made manifest.</p>
		  	<p>Again we are assured that our righteousness is of God. How powerful! We are not made righteous by our works, but faith in God. We are not approved by men, but God! Therefore, people’s opinion about you is not what counts.</p>
		  	<p>However, note that this is not a heritage for just anyone, but servants of the Lord. Being your own servant, making decisions of your own, and being a man of your will and senses, only places you in a position of vulnerability and insecurity. It makes you prone to the schemes of the enemy.</p>
		  	<p>The assurance of security only binds those within the concise of service to God. Beloved, serving God must not necessarily be done in any of the five Spiritual offices.</p>
		  	<p>We serve God by aligning and submitting our plans to God’s perfect will; we serve God by obedience; we serve God by keeping His Words; we serve God in faith.</p>
		  	<p>Insecurity is a word that only binds those in the earthly realm; a man who is sold out to God’s perfect will is sure of security. Cast away fear; as long as you have God, you are well secured! Be blessed!</p>
