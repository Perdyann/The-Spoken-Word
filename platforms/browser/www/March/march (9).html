		  	<p><i>On the seventh day, when the heart of the king was merry with wine, he commanded Mehuman, Biztha, Harbona, Bigtha, and Abagtha, Zethar, and Carcas, the seven chamberlains that served in the presence of Ahasuerus the king, To bring Vashti the queen before the king with the crown royal, to shew the people and the princes her beauty: for she was fair to look on.</i></p>
		  	<p><i>But the queen Vashti refused to come at the king’s commandment by his chamberlains: therefore was the king very wroth, and his anger burned in him. (Esther 1:10-12)</i></p>

		  	<blockquote>Refusal to respond to the higher call, results in replacement.</blockquote>

		  	<p>At such a time, when the King needed to show forth his Queen to the multitude... At such a time when her presence was eagerly anticipated... There went a call from the King to his Queen; she blatantly ignored it!</p>
		  	<p>There is nothing else that drove Queen Vashti from the Kingdom, other than her deliberate refusal to respond to the higher call.</p>
		  	<p>Beloved, just like the King to Vashti, there is a call on our lives; do we walk in line with this call? Or do we flee from it, because it doesn’t seem to have as much prospects as what we are already entangled in?</p>
		  	<p>Refusal to respond to the higher call, results in replacement. The King proved to Esther, that she could be replaced. It is written,</p>
		  	<p><i>“If it please the king, let there go a royal commandment from him, and let it be written among the laws of the Persians and the Medes, that it be not altered, That Vashti come no more before king Ahasuerus; and let the king give her royal estate unto another that is better than she.” (Esther 1:19)</i></p>
		  	<p>Indeed, the royal estate, her royal position, and honor, which she had attained from the time past, was within a split second, handed over to someone, who was perceived to be better than she, simply because she ignored the Divine call.</p>
		  	<p>Brethren, do not make the mistake Vashti made; it is a mistake, which she may have regretted, but could not reverse. She was already replaced! Jesus gave one of such kinds of parables:</p>
		  	<p><i>Then saith he to his servants, The wedding is ready, but they which were bidden were not worthy.</i></p>
		  	<p><i>Go ye therefore into the highways, and as many as ye shall find, bid to the marriage. (Matthew 22:8-9)</i></p>
		  	<p>When the master of the house had sent forth invitations for the wedding feast, those who were initially called, ignored the call. They were immediately replaced by other mere men, who were found on the highways. Again, Jesus said:</p>
		  	<p><i>And he answered and said unto them, I tell you that, if these should hold their peace, the stones would immediately cry out. (Luke 19:40)</i></p>
		  	<p>Beloved, if men will no longer serve the Lord, they will immediately be replaced by stones.</p>
		  	<p>It is important that we understand the offices we occupy, and act rightly, according to the will of God. Every man is replaceable!</p>
		  	<p>If Vashti could be replaced by Esther... if the special guests could be replaced by street hucksters... if indeed, the praises from stones can replace that of men... Then it is time to respond to the Divine call.</p>
		  	<p>There is a Divine call; an awakening call. Rise up to your purpose; the time for the fulfillment of your assignment is here. The time for the manifestation of the ancient spoken words is here. Hearken to that call this day; shun it not!</p>
		  	<p>There is a call to our children to live the life of God; there is a call to our youth, to be set ablaze for our Lord; there is a call to the Parents to imbibe in their families, the life of God; there is a call to this generation to wake up, and live above the world.</p>
		  	<p>We need not to conform to the standards of this world. There is a call for us to transform the world from within. Where are those days when people burned passionately in service of God? Stand out from your environment this day, turn a new leaf. There is a Divine call!</p>
