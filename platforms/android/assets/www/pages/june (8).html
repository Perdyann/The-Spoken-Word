		  	<p><i>This day will the Lord deliver thee into mine hand; and I will smite thee, and take thine head from thee; and I will give the carcases of the host of the Philistines this day unto the fowls of the air, and to the wild beasts of the earth; that all the earth may know that there is a God in Israel. (1 Samuel 17:46)</i></p>

		  	<blockquote>Except you have a clearly defined vision, goal, target and focus you will fall for anything.</blockquote>

		  	<p>An athlete never starts running without a vision of the end-line. All through the race, he keeps his eyes on that line, and refuses to get distracted.</p>
		  	<p>I used to be a very poor athlete, because, rather than looking at the end-line, I always looked at my competitors beside and behind me. This continued, until I learnt this truth — never start any race without a target, and never take your eyes off the target — </p>
		  	<p>The scripture referenced today, was the exact statement of David to Goliath before the battle began; it’s amazing to comprehend that David was able to clearly define his exact goals and target, before he even attempted to throw a stone at Goliath.</p>
		  	<p>More amazing is the fact that he affixed a time limit to his target. He did not just presume that someday he will defeat Goliath, but he said, 'this day ... '</p>
		  	<p>The issue with many of us is that we start running a race or project without a set target, vision, goal and time.</p>
		  	<p>You cannot start a battle, and expect to win, if you don’t know what exactly you want from it, and when you want the victory.</p>
		  	<p>People have taken ten years to achieve a project that should have been achieved in one year. Why? They never visualized the time of completion before the commencement of the project. Be like David, who declared the time of his victory before the fight began.</p>
		  	<p>Many people are caught up in a mess, which they cannot get out of; they are double-mindedly stuck in one pot hole or another. Why? They didn’t set a target or goal before they started the race. Be like David, who spoke in clear terms, exactly what he wanted from the battle, even before it began.</p>
		  	<p>David did not just approach Goliath, with a hope to defeat him. He clearly stated that he wanted Goliath’s head, and that, he did get. His entire focus was on getting Goliaths head before the end of the day. That focus granted him exactly what he wanted. What is your focus?</p>
		  	<p>If you have not seen the end of any battle, don’t start fighting yet; if you have not seen the end of any race, don’t start running yet; if you have not seen the end result of a project, don’t start it yet; Never start anything without vision!</p>
		  	<p>It is better to have clearly defined goals before the start, than to start up something without vision, and get caught up in it.</p>
		  	<p>Except you have a clearly defined vision, goal, target and focus you will fall for anything. When you are setting your target and goals, don’t limit God; understand that God can do the impossible.</p>
		  	<p>David did not reason in actuality, whether or not he was capable of defeating and beheading Goliath, before he began to make such powerful declarations.</p>
		  	<p>Don’t set goals based on the present conditions of things. No! Don’t be myopic; look beyond the ordinary, and see beyond the boundaries of possibility.</p>
		  	<p>Beloved, define your goals as you visualize them, without even considering its possibility. When setting your target, set it without limits whatsoever. You can do all things! Be blessed!</p>
