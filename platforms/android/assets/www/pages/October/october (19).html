		  	<p><i>And all things are of God, who hath reconciled us to himself by Jesus Christ, and hath given to us the ministry of reconciliation; (2 Corinthians 5:18)</i></p>

		  	<blockquote>The mistake of many Christians is their ignorant struggle and pursuit to attain that, which we have been freely given already.</blockquote>

		  	<p>So much has been spelt out by virtue of our new birth in Christ, but ignorance has deprived many of the ability to operate therein. Do you know that we are reconciled to God already?</p>
		  	<p>The interesting aspect of this scripture is the use of past tense in describing our new status. It states, “who hath reconciled us” it is never quoted that He will reconcile us to Himself very soon. No! It has been done already.</p>
		  	<p>The mistake of many Christians is their ignorant struggle and pursuit to attain that, which we have been freely given already. When you understand what is yours already, you’d begin to produce sweatless results.</p>
		  	<p>We have been reconciled to God already; in the olden days, people never had direct access to God; they had to go through the appointed priests. When they sinned, they had to cover up their sins with the blood of animals.</p>
		  	<p>However, through the death and resurrection of Jesus, we have been reconciled to Him. When you are born-again, you receive remission of all your sins, and all records of the past are cleansed, as though they never existed. You become new!</p>
		  	<p>This new man is reconciled to God already; we are made just as righteous as Jesus is! What we should understand is that our reconciliation to God is not by our works or efforts, but a free gift. Our righteousness is not weighed based on how well we have acted, but by this reconciliation.</p>
		  	<p>A born again man grows in grace, and faith, but one thing he does not grow in is righteousness. You can never be more righteous than you are now, no matter how much effort you put in. This is because; righteousness is not attained by efforts, but given freely.</p>
		  	<p>Seeing then that God has reconciled us to himself already, why then should we ever feel ashamed of His presence, even when we have done wrong? Ignorance!</p>
		  	<p>A lot of Christians believe that their righteousness is based on works; if justification were by the law, no man can ever be right.</p>
		  	<p>Seeing then that we have been reconciled to God already, there is no point praying for that reconciliation anymore. When we are newly born again, we receive remission of sins; during our walk in Christ, we receive forgiveness of sins; therefore, there is no reason why we shouldn’t be confident to have a right stand in God.</p>
		  	<p>Adam and Eve hid from God when they sinned, because the new covenant was not yet manifest then; beloved, Jesus has risen now; nothing is capable of making us to hide from His presence. We have been reconciled to Him, and made the righteousness of God.</p>
		  	<p>We have been given the ministry of reconciliation. Our focus now is to take the gospel of salvation to the ends of the earth, so that the world might come to the full knowledge of our new identity in Him. Be blessed!</p>
