		  	<p><i>They devoted themselves to the apostles’ teaching and to fellowship, to the breaking of bread and to prayer. (Acts 2:42)</i></p>


		  	<blockquote>The knowledge you had yesterday, will be expired by tomorrow; learn something new today.</blockquote>

		  	<p>Many people wrongly embrace the thought and belief that the church is a building, where worship is done. The definitions of a church, by different dictionaries, contrast that which is scriptural.</p>
		  	<p>As a result of this, when people hear the word church, they envisage a physical structure. But that’s a very wrong perception of the church; in understanding what a church really is, we need to refer to the scripture, and not the dictionary.</p>
		  	<p>The church is the body of Christ; it is not formed by physical structures, but spiritual characteristics and qualities. The book of Acts throws more light to the beginning—the early church.</p>
		  	<p>The church is a body devoted to the Word of God. If the Word of God is absent, the church cannot exist, for the church is born of the Word.</p>
		  	<p>As it is written, the people of the early church were devoted to the teachings of the Word of God, done by the Apostles. According to the Word, which they lived by, they were also devoted to fellowshipping, breaking of bread and prayers.</p>
		  	<p>They were hungry for knowledge, never satisfied with what they knew. The more they were taught daily, the more they desired to learn new things.</p>
		  	<p>Likewise beloved, never rely on what you know already, be devoted to learning new things. Never be satisfied with your level of knowledge, there is always something new to know.</p>
		  	<p>The world keeps changing by the days; the knowledge you had yesterday, will be expired by tomorrow. Therefore, there’s no point relying only on what we’ve always known. Today, be devoted to learning new things that will speak for you tomorrow, when all past knowledge becomes stale.</p>
		  	<p>Just like the case of the early Church, God expects us to grow in revelation. The revelations we received yesterday are not enough to sustain us for a lifetime; we need to keep learning.</p>
		  	<p>Never neglect fellowship; take advantage of every opportunity to learn from the Word of God, to share insights and Truth.</p>
		  	<p>The Apostles, Pastors, Teachers, Evangelists, and Prophets are ordained by God, to equip the body of Christ (Church) for the work of Ministry. We should be sold out to learning from them. Listen to messages and books that edify, with a willingness to learn something new.</p>
		  	<p>Here’s the point, we cannot claim to be a part of the church, and not be devoted to learning the Word of Truth. Our extent of devotion to the things of God is what qualifies us to be called a church.</p>
		  	<p>We can never exhaust God; we can never finish learning from the Word of God. There is always something new to be learnt. Get devoted to learning more from God’s Word, fellowshipping, breaking bread, and praying. Be blessed!</p>
