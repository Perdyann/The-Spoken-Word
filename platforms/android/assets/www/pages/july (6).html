		  	<p><i>“Now a traveler came to the rich man, but the rich man refrained from taking one of his own sheep or cattle to prepare a meal for the traveler who had come to him. Instead, he took the ewe lamb that belonged to the poor man and prepared it for the one who had come to him.” (2 Samuel 12:4 NIV)</i></p>

		  	<blockquote>Whatsoever is birthed by our selfish desires and ambition is bound to be short-lived, but anything breathed upon by God outlives time. </blockquote>

		  	<p>Isn’t it crazy how someone could be in possession of valuable treasures, but choose to spare it, and obtain that of another person, through selfish means? Man in his human nature is selfish!</p>
		  	<p>However, when a man is translated from being just human, to being a partaker of God’s Divine nature, it ceases to be the case. He becomes selfless. A carnal man delights in obtaining more treasures through selfish means, but a spiritual man is selflessly sold out to service.</p>
		  	<p>The scripture is an excerpt from the words of Nathan to David, after he had gotten Bathsheba through selfish means. He was likened to a rich man who had so many sheep, but spared them and rather seized from the poor man the only sheep he had.</p>
		  	<p>David could have as many concubines as he wanted; he could marry as many wives as he desired; but he chose to get the only wife Uriah had, and killed him, in order to cover up his deeds. It is appalling how far people can go to cover up their selfish deeds.</p>
		  	<p>David felt more comfortable to know that Uriah was out of the track, and he could have Bathsheba all to himself. He never considered how selfish he had been until Nathan used that illustration.</p>
		  	<p>His reaction to Nathan after he had told the story of the selfish rich man was judgmental. He was willing to prosecute the selfish rich man, without realizing that he was the one. This further goes to prove how selfish man could be.</p>
		  	<p>God was not displeased with David because he had an affair with a married woman, but God’s anger was propelled by his level of selfishness.</p>
		  	<p>Even when David admitted that he had sinned, and God had forgiven him, the seed borne through David’s act of selfishness still had to die. That went a long way to prove that anything obtained through selfish means can never last long.</p>
		  	<p>If you want a long lasting treasure, earn it through selfless service; the results of selfishness dies almost immediately after its birth.</p>
		  	<p>The means through which anything is obtained matters much more than the thing itself because the means determines how long it will last in your hands, and how credible it will be.</p>
		  	<p>Whatsoever is birthed by our selfish desires and ambition is bound to be short-lived, but anything breathed upon by God outlives time.</p>
		  	<p>Earning more than you have is alright, but don’t make an earning through selfish means, it’s always not worth it. Be blessed!</p>
