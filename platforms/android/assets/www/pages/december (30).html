		  	<p><i>For verily I say unto you, That whosoever shall say unto this mountain, Be thou removed, and be thou cast into the sea; and shall not doubt in his heart, but shall believe that those things which he saith shall come to pass; he shall have whatsoever he saith. (Mark 11:23)</i></p>
		  
		  	<blockquote>The only things you don’t have today are the things you never said yesterday. The brightness of the future is determined by the faith-filled words of the present day. </blockquote>

		  	<p>Did you see that? We shall have whatsoever we say! Verily, the only things you don’t have today are the things you never said yesterday.</p>
		  	<p>What we have today is as a result of the faith-filled confessions we made yesterday, and to a large extent, tomorrow is determined by the level and power of confessions we make today.</p>
		  	<p>When we speak to the mountain, it becomes a plain; how can we expect the mountain to become a plain when we have not yet spoken to it in faith? The reason why you are surrounded by mountains of limitation is because you are yet to speak to them in faith.</p>
		  	<p>You are surrounded by the results of your confession; perhaps, all you’ve ever said in life is, “I can’t move forward, there are so many limitations and mountains ahead.” How do you actually expect to move forward, when you still retain such negative confessions?</p>
		  	<p>The scripture rightly states that we shall have whatsoever we say. When you speak limitations, that’s exactly what you have.</p>
		  	<p>My spirit has been programmed to speak only words of edification; I always say, “I can never be limited in life. I am unstoppable and immovable.” Today, I enjoy the results and benefits of these confessions.</p>
		  	<p>Quite a lot of people apply for visas to different nations, and are denied. This is because they have never spoken in that direction. I always say, “I can never be denied access into any nation; the doors of all nations are opened unto me” Beloved, I still enjoy the results of such confessions.</p>
		  	<p>When the clouds are full of rain, they empty themselves on the earth: every faith-filled word you speak forms a cloud, and when it is heavy, the results and blessings are showered on you. If you are single, begin to speak to your marriage; the brightness of the future is determined by the faith-filled words of the present day.</p>
		  	<p>We shall have whatsoever we say; don’t complain when you don’t have anything, just say it in faith. In the beginning, God did not complain about the darkness and formlessness of the earth, He simply spoke light and shape in faith.</p>
		  	<p>The earth became a result of the confession (Word) of God; what you have is a result of your confession.</p>
		  	<p>Don’t complain about a situation, which you have not spoken faith to. Situations never respond to our tears or complain, but our Words of Faith. We shall have whatsoever we say — speak in faith! Be blessed!</p>
