		  <div class="panel-body" style="text-align:justify">


		  	<p><i>Everyone was filled with awe at the many wonders and signs performed by the apostles. (Acts 2:43 NIV)</i></p>
		  	

		  	<blockquote>Until you align your will and desires to God’s plan and purpose for your life, you have not started revering  Him yet. </blockquote>

		  	<p>Not only is the church a body devoted to the Word of God, it is a body that reveres God. A body that lacks reverence for God is not a church.</p>
		  	<p>In the early Church, everyone had a deep feeling of reverential respect for God, when they saw the signs and wonders performed by the Apostles. </p>
		  	<p>There are some things you will not do, there are some stands you will not compromise and there are some actions you will not take if you really revere God. Revering God is having the fear of God.</p>
		  	<p>When a man’s actions, principles and ways are ordered and propelled by the Fear of God, and deep reverence for Him, he is sure to soar on Divine heights. On the contrary, when a man makes decisions, and takes actions without regarding God, he will easily get caught up in a mess that has no way out.</p>
		  	<p>What determines your destination in life is the route you take today. There is no better route to greatness than revering God. When you place God in charge of your life and affairs, He makes you to walk in high places.</p>
		  	<p>Jesus Christ is coming back for His Church; He is not coming back to rapture members of any physical structure or building, but members of the body that are full of reverence for God.</p>
		  	<p>If you lack reverence for God, if you don’t have the fear of God; then you are not a member of the body of Christ, for reverence is one of the main features of the body of Christ.</p>
		  	<p>If you revere God, you will not make decisions without acknowledging Him; you will not do that, which He has told you not to do; you will not compromise your stand in Him for earthly pleasures.</p>
		  	<p>More than you desire to live out your plans and ambitions, be sold out to fulfilling God’s Divine purpose for your life. Until you align your will and desires to God’s plan and purpose for your life, you have not started revering Him yet.</p>
		  	<p>He, who fears God, is wise; He, who reveres God, will never be let down. Be blessed!</p>
