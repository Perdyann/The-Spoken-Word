		  	<p><i>O give thanks unto the Lord; call upon his name: make known his deeds among the people.</i></p>
		  	<p><i>Sing unto him, sing psalms unto him: talk ye of all his wondrous works.</i></p>
		  	<p><i>Glory ye in his holy name: let the heart of them rejoice that seek the Lord. </i></p>
		  	<p><i>Seek the Lord, and his strength: seek his face evermore.</i></p>
		  	<p><i>Remember his marvellous works that he hath done; his wonders, and the judgments of his mouth; (Psalms 105:1-5)</i></p>


		  	<blockquote>A heart that is grateful can never notice anything unfortunate; indeed a thankful heart cannot remain wretched.</blockquote>

		  	<p>When you focus on your problems, and pay too much attention to your desires not yet met; then you’d find it really difficult to count your blessings.</p>
		  	<p>The issue with most people is that rather than capitalizing on the daily blessings of God, they focus on the extra things not yet done. It is easier for them to approach God, complaining about their unanswered prayers, than to thank Him for what He’s done.</p>
		  	<p>The miracles God has performed in my life are so much that I cannot think of anything that’s still lacking. The promises of God I walk into daily is so much that I can hardly notice any problem.</p>
		  	<p>When will we start counting our blessings rather than our predicaments?</p>
		  	<p>The scripture today portrays the grateful and joyful attitude of the Psalmist as he praises God. He goes ahead to admonish everyone to remember the marvelous and wonderful works of God.</p>
		  	<p>Why allow the bitterness of your heart, towards an unmet desire, to rip you off the joy of thanksgiving? Why allow the sadness of what you don’t have to make you too blind to realize how much you have?</p>
		  	<p>As I always say, God has done so much for me, that if He chooses not to do anything else, I will still be grateful for what He has already done.</p>
		  	<p>It is time to understand that the more you focus on ill predicaments, the more you get blinded, lest you see the daily showers of blessings God releases on us; The reason why you’ve not realized how blessed you are, is because you’ve been too focused on how wretched and unfortunate everything around seems.</p>
		  	<p>Verily, when you change your focus, and spare a moment to count your blessings, it will be impossible for you to still notice anything wretched or unfortunate about your life.</p>
		  	<p>It was not until I fell ill that I learnt to appreciate health; I have been sick before, and I recall that the only thing I desired then was to be upright and feel normal. I thank God that I eventually discovered the truth about Divine health.</p>
		  	<p>Beloved, in every situation, there is always a blessing to be grateful for;</p>
		  	<p>When you wake up every morning, thank God for the new blessings of health, joy and peace showered upon you; thank God for His wisdom at work in you; thank God for His ability that enables you to do the extraordinary.</p>
		  	<p>A heart that is grateful can never notice anything unfortunate; indeed a thankful heart cannot remain wretched. Remember the miracles God has done in your life . . . count your blessings and you’d be amazed how they’d overshadow every predicament. Be blessed!</p>
