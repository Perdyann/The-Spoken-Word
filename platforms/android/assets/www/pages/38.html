		  	<h5><strong>FAITH: Has got Different Measures; grow it!</strong></h5>

		  	<p><i>For I say, through the grace given unto me, to every man that is among you, not to think of himself more highly than he ought to think; but to think soberly, according as God hath dealt to every man the measure of faith. (Romans 12:3)</i></p>
		  


		  	<blockquote>The level of your faith, determines the extent and dynamite of your result...</blockquote>

		  	<p>Faith indeed has got different measures. There is a level of faith that heals the sick... there is another level that raises the dead... There is a level that has the capacity to fix back an ear that has been cut off... There is a level that sustains a man to walk on water... It all depends on the measure of faith.</p>
		  	<p>While there is a measure of faith that moves, shakes, and lifts mountains; there is another measure that can barely shift stones. Grow your faith!</p>
		  	<p>Have you ever examined the statements of Jesus that preceded most healing occurrences? He always said, “Be it done to you according to your faith.” In other words, if you’ve got little or no faith, there’d be little or no results; but if you’ve got a giant faith, with no doubts, you shall receive tremendous results. Indeed, the level of your faith, determines the extent and dynamite of your result.</p>
		  	<p><i>And the apostles said unto the Lord, Increase our faith. And the Lord said, If ye had faith as a grain of mustard seed, ye might say unto this sycamine tree, Be thou plucked up by the root, and be thou planted in the sea; and it should obey you. (Luke 17:5-6)</i></p>
		  	<p>What exactly was meant when Jesus likened the faith of the apostles to that of a mustard seed? Indeed, Jesus wasn’t saying that a little faith could cause vast transformations, He was only giving light to the truth that a growing faith can do impossible things. Indeed, there is a huge difference between a little faith and a growing faith. The mustard seed is not just a little seed, but a growing seed.</p>
		  	<p>Verily, the strength of a mustard seed is not in its initial size, but its ability to grow. Though very small and unrecognisable, the mustard seed grows to be the largest of trees. What God needs from people with the mustard seed faith, is to grow it. The power of a seed is not in its size, but its ability to grow and transform to a giant tree.</p>
		  	<p>There is a deposit of faith in every Christian, but you need to grow it, in order for it to yield you the desired result. Faith is grown by the Word, and weakened by sin. The flesh and the Spirit are constantly at war... Faith is the product of the Spirit, and Sin is the product of the flesh.</p>
		  	<p>The more you indulge in sin, the weaker your Spirit becomes, and invariably, it weakens the faith. Likewise, the more of God’s Word you absorb, the more your faith comes alive, and the less the things of this world matters to you. In this sense, the flesh is weakened, and the Spirit comes alive.</p>
		  	<p>Living in the flesh makes a believer to derail, and operate from the standpoint of the flesh, and this weakens the faith because carnality has taken over the Spiritual man in him; But the Word of God is the material used to build your faith. It is written,</p>
		  	<p><i>So then faith cometh by hearing, and hearing by the word of God. (Romans 10:17)</i></p>
		  	<p>The origin of faith is the Word of God. What God expects us to do with the measure of faith in us, is not to bury it, but to grow it in the Word. Beloved, today, spare some time to study the Word. Charge up your faith in God’s Word, and watch your faith fling off the tallest mountains.</p>
		  	<p>When Jesus spoke to the storms, they instantly became calm. Grow your faith in the Word, abstain from the passions of the flesh, and speak! For even the storms and mountains obey the voice of faith. You are blessed!</p>
