		  	<p><i>All the believers were together and had everything in common. (Acts 2:44)</i></p>

		  	<blockquote>Breaking a single stick of broom is much easier than breaking a pile of broomsticks bonded together. </blockquote>

		  	<p>There is a common lesson of togetherness, often portrayed using broomsticks. It is said, breaking a single stick of broom is much easier than breaking a pile of broomsticks bonded together.</p>
		  	<p>When a stick is on its own, it can easily be bent, crushed and destroyed, but when it is in the company of other sticks, it is fairly infeasible to destroy it.</p>
		  	<p>Just like the broomsticks, any nation that is divided against itself cannot stand; any organization or body that does not share the same commonalities, goals and are not blended in unity can easily be accessed and destroyed.</p>
		  	<p>Little wonder it is said, “united we stand, divided we fall.” When a body is united in love, sold out to God, and founded on the Word of God, it cannot but stand firm against all odds. It is written:</p>
		  	<p><i>And the eye cannot say unto the hand, I have no need of thee: nor again the head to the feet, I have no need of you. (1 Corinthians 12:21)</i></p>
		  	<p>Different members work together, for the human body to function properly. What the eye does, the hands cannot do; but when all parts work together, nothing remains undone.</p>
		  	<p>Likewise, not one ministry has the entirety of God. What makes a church is the ability for different members to work together, for the body to function properly. Without togetherness, there is no body and no church.</p>
		  	<p>If there’s one quality that shouldn’t be lacking in any Church, it is togetherness. The believers of the early Church remained conscious of this; they had everything in common, and stayed together always.</p>
		  	<p>Togetherness does not necessarily imply being physically present with someone, but being spiritually connected to everyone. They might not have seen everyone on a daily basis, but made efforts to pray for them, and show concern at all seasons.</p>
		  	<p>Beloved, how connected are you to your brethren? How available are you to meet the needs of others? How concerned are you about your neighbors?</p>
		  	<p>Just like the human body works, when one part is injured, the hurt is felt everywhere. When a single toe is amputated, the whole body feels the pain, because there is a connection.</p>
		  	<p>Rejoice with those who rejoice, share with those who need, be a blessing to everyone. We are united by one God, one blood, and one Word. Be blessed!</p>
