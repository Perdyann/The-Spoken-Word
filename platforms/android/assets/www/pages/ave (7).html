		  	<p><i>For this very reason, make every effort to supplement your faith with virtue, and virtue with knowledge, and knowledge with self-control, and self-control with steadfastness, and steadfastness with godliness, and godliness with brotherly affection, and brotherly affection with love.</i></p>
		  	<p><i>For if these qualities are yours and are increasing, they keep you from being ineffective or unfruitful in the knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ.</i></p>
		  	<p><i>For whoever lacks these qualities is so nearsighted that he is blind, having forgotten that he was cleansed from his former sins.</i></p>
		  	<p><i>Therefore, brothers, be all the more diligent to confirm your calling and election, for if you practice these qualities you will never fall. (2 Peter 1:5-10 ESV)</i></p>


		  	<blockquote>A mere man experiences ups and downs on a daily basis, but the spiritual man only ascend from great to greater heights.</blockquote>

		  	<p>How powerful! This passage ends with a powerful assurance - you will never fall, trip or stumble.</p>
		  	<p>The fear of many great men is fall! No one wants to trip and backslide. However, men, in their own capacity have tried to keep themselves from falling, yet to them it remained inevitable, thus pushing them to the conclusion that life is full of ups and downs.</p>
		  	<p>A mere man experiences ups and downs on a daily basis, but the spiritual man only ascend from great to greater heights. Here is a life of no backwardness or fall guaranteed; embrace it!</p>
		  	<p>For this reason; what reason? God has granted us all things, and we are made partakers of His Divine Nature, through the knowledge of Him (vs.3-4). Therefore: Add</p>
		  	<p>Faith + Virtue (Holy Living, excellence) + Knowledge (Better understanding, intelligence) + Self control (Say no when you need to) + Steadfastness (Do not give up) + Godliness (Full of God) + Brotherly affection (Kind to one another) + Love.</p>
		  	<p>To your faith and virtue, add understanding. By understanding, a house is made strong and established (Proverbs 24:3-4); therefore, through the establishment you gain from knowledge, you can be strong enough to say no when you need to.</p>
		  	<p>Always persevere in steadfastness; don’t give up! Live the God-life, for verily, we are gods on earth, made to reign and subdue. Be kind, and above all, LOVE. Above everything we could ever have or do, let us love.</p>
		  	<p>Love binds everything together in perfect harmony. Without love, every other quality becomes void.</p>
		  	<p>Peter continued, <i> ‘For if these qualities are yours and are increasing’ </i> take note of the word increasing. In essence, we should not be satisfied with our level of knowledge, virtue and all yet; but we should grow continually in them. There is something higher than what we already have. Don’t be mediocre. Increase!</p>
		  	<p>Increasing in these qualities keep us from being unfruitful in the Knowledge of Our Lord. Beloved, knowledge is powerful, as it gives us access to all things, including God’s Divine Nature. If you don’t increase in these qualities, you may remain unfruitful, ignorant, and lacking everything.</p>
		  	<p>Peter continues, <i> ‘For whoever lacks these qualities is so nearsighted that he is blind, having forgotten that he was cleansed from his former sins.’ </i> It is evident why no amount of sermon can keep some believers from struggling with their old ways of life; they keep returning, like dogs to their vomit.</p>
		  	<p>Finally brethren, be all the more DILIGENT. The use of the term, ‘all the more’ entails that we should be more diligent than we have ever been in our entire life-time. Be conscious of your stand in God always; be sure that you are constantly increasing in these qualities.</p>
		  	<p>Now, here’s the assurance: <i> ‘for if you practice these qualities <b> you will never fall.</b>’ </i> Glory to God! If these qualities are increasingly yours, you will never fall! Not today, not in the future. Our future is insured already!</p>
		  	<p>Begin to make these confessions now: My steps are ordered by the Lord; I am the righteous, none of my steps shall slide; I am growing in knowledge, faith, love, steadfastness, self-control and godliness; the Holy Spirit lives and functions in me. I AM A SUCCESS!</p>
