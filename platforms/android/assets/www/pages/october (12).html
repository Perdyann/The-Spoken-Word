		  	<p><i>Then shall the kingdom of heaven be likened unto ten virgins, which took their lamps, and went forth to meet the bridegroom. (Genesis 25:1)</i></p>
		  

		  	<blockquote>At every stage of life, there is a test; only people who remain undefiled despite the ordeal, are qualified for greater positions.</blockquote>

		  	<p>There are positions, which have virginity as one of the key qualifications. Ever thought of the parable of the ten virgins? What qualified these ten ladies to go wait for the bridegroom was their virginity. What qualified Mary to be pregnant with baby Jesus was her virginity. What qualified Rebekah to be considered a wife for Isaac was her virginity.</p>
		  	<p>Virginity is always a key qualification at the initial stage. If the ten ladies were not virgins, they wouldn’t dare to wait for the bridegroom. (They’d be disqualified already)</p>
		  	<p>If Mary was not a virgin, Jesus will not have been born through her; it was foretold that the savior will be born of a virgin. (Isaiah 7:14). In essence, virginity was a key qualification for that position.</p>
		  	<p>Furthermore, when Abraham’s servant sought a wife for Isaac, his only sign was that the virgin will give him water upon request, and his camels also. (Genesis 24:43) In essence, this servant stood by the well, not looking out for anyone else, but a virgin, who will meet his requirements.</p>
		  	<p>If these fellows were not virgins, it would have been impossible for them to be in their positions.</p>
		  	<p>Virginity in these contexts is from a natural standpoint; however, we are going to analyze it from a spiritual perspective. Naturally, when a woman has not lain with a man, she is a virgin; from a spiritual scope, virginity means being undefiled.</p>
		  	<p>In essence, when Daniel, Shedrach, Meshach and Abednego decided not to defile themselves with the fats of the king, they were simply preserving their virginity (Daniel 1:8). We have realized that it qualified them for greater positions ahead.</p>
		  	<p>Here’s the point, at every stage of life, there is a test; only people who remain undefiled despite the ordeal, are qualified for greater positions. There is always a temptation to compromise and be defiled, but those who remain virgins till the end are qualified.</p>
		  	<p>Bribery and corruption is defilement! You don’t need to be involved in bribery or any corrupt act to attain a great position. God exalts those who have remained undefiled despite the corrupt system of the world.</p>
		  	<p>Don’t be defiled by the system of the world; don’t be shaped by the principles of the world; don’t conform to worldly standards.</p>
		  	<p>Just like Mary, there is a unique pregnancy and a great release of God in this season to many—only virgins will qualify to birth those great visions. Just like the ten virgins, there is a divine visitation that holds a great package—only virgins can qualify for this.</p>
		  	<p>Abraham’s servant stood close-by just looking out for a virgin; likewise, God is looking out for people who will remain undefiled despite their challenging situations.</p>
		  	<p>Understand that my scope is not natural virginity, but being undefiled. There is a reward for people who go through ordeal, but refuse to compromise or be defiled by their situation.</p>
		  	<p>Lack is not enough reason to steal; unemployment is not enough reason to use fake documents; there is never enough justification for being defiled. You can go through the worst situation in life, and still remain the best.</p>
		  	<p>Don’t be in haste to compromise, hold on to the truth; you were not sent to the world to conform to its standards, but to transform it. Be blessed!</p>
