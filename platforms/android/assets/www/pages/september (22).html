		  	<p><i>Verily, verily, I say unto you, The hour is coming, and now is, when the dead shall hear the voice of the Son of God: and they that hear shall live. (John 5:25)</i></p>

		  	<blockquote>By a single utterance of faith, you can redeem life from a dead stuff. </blockquote>

		  	<p>It is an error for a man to be in Christ, and still have dead situations in his life. Beloved, we are in an era, season, and hour when dead things rise at the sound of the voice of Sons of God — our voice!</p>
		  	<p>Who are the Sons of God? If we are Sons of God, it is highly erroneous to still tolerate things without life. When dead things hear your voice, let them live.</p>
		  	<p>What do you do when things start crumbling? What do you do when your situation only gets worse by the days? What do you do, when circumstances seem way below your expectation? Speak the Word!</p>
		  	<p>As long as you are a Son of God, there is no dead thing that can hear your voice, and remain dead.</p>
		  	<p>When the dry bones heard the prophecies of Ezekiel, they began to rumble until they were covered with flesh and received life; When Lazarus heard the voice of Jesus, he rose from the dead; when Tabitha heard the voice of Peter, she received life. I am yet to encounter a situation where the dead heard the voice of a Son, and remained as it was.</p>
		  	<p>You might not have much, but with what you have, you can possess everything; your voice can call forth things that be not as though they were. By a single utterance of faith, you can redeem life from a dead stuff.</p>
		  	<p>Beloved, as Sons of God, our words and voices are not ordinary; we speak a different language with authority. Therefore, no mountain can remain standing at the sound of our voice; nothing can remain dead after we have spoken</p>
		  	<p>Just like it was in the valley of dry bones, God is set to give life to those very things, which everyone has pronounced dead; God is set to revive the dead aspect of our lives; all you need to do is to prophesy and speak the Word of God.</p>
		  	<p>Don’t be discouraged by the dryness of the bones, they can still live; don’t be frightened by the report of the Doctors, declare the Word; don’t be intimidated by the size of the mountains and giants posed before you, speak the Word.</p>
		  	<p>When Goliath was posed before David, the latter chose not to be frightened by the gigantic stature of the former; all He did was to speak the Word of the Lord in faith. In no time, that giant was defeated and beheaded.</p>
		  	<p>Even in the most hopeless situation, the Word of the Lord paves a Way. What do you speak? Ask yourself this question today, “Are my words capable of reviving a hopelessly dead situation?” If your answer is no, then obviously you’ve been speaking the wrong words.</p>
		  	<p>Complain cannot give life to hopelessness; Negative words cannot birth positivity; only the Word of God can work extra-ordinary wonders. Be sure to speak the Word of God over every situation you face today. Be blessed!</p>
