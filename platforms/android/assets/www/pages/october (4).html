		  	<p><i>Let us therefore come boldly unto the throne of grace, that we may obtain mercy, and find grace to help in time of need. (Hebrews 4:16)</i></p>
		  	
		  	<blockquote>I am a Spirit; my wealth is not defined by what my earthly account holds, but what my heavenly account can produce.</blockquote>

		  	<p>eviously, when we studied the throne of grace, we likened it to a Kingdom account with unlimited virtues, which can be accessed only by Sons of God. The truth is, as Sons of God, we have a heavenly account; thus, our wealth is in no way determined by the size of our earthly account.</p>
		  	<p>I always thought that I was living on my bank account (earthly), thus, when there was no money in there, I considered myself broke, and when it was loaded, I knew I was rich. As long as I relied on my earthly account, I lived a very limited life.</p>
		  	<p>Every month, my salary was paid into my account, and I could not live above what was paid into my account. I was living a limited life, but never realized it until I discovered that as a Son of God, I should rely on my Kingdom account and not the earthly one.</p>
		  	<p>“I am a Spirit; my wealth is not defined by what my earthly account holds, but what my heavenly account can produce.” With this single realization, I broke through every physical and financial limitation.</p>
		  	<p>Previously, when I saw materials, which were important for my Ministry, I always murmured, ‘O, I cannot afford it, because I don’t have much in my account’—I was referring to my earthly account.</p>
		  	<p>In no time, the Lord revealed to me, that the reason why I have been limited is because I have relied on my earthly account. Beloved, until you stop relying on what is in your earthly account, and start tapping into your kingdom account, you cannot break through.</p>
		  	<p>Now, when I see materials for my Ministry, I tap into my Kingdom account, and call them forth. I receive them without struggles.</p>
		  	<p>I spoke with a colleague sometime ago, and he complained about his many worries. He said, “I don’t even know how my transport for next week will be paid, because I’d only receive my salary next month.” This fellow is born-again, yet he was ignorantly placing his hopes and trust on his salary and earthly account.</p>
		  	<p>Until you take your focus away from your earthly account, to your kingdom account, you can never do exploits. Quit worrying about earthly things; they are not capable of holding a man of faith down. Walk by faith, and not fear or worries!</p>
		  	<p>Some complain saying, “my salary is not even enough to pay my rent ...” What they fail to realize is that they are Sons of God, and your Father will not leave you homeless simply because your earthly account is red.</p>
		  	<p>Here’s the point beloved, make your living out of your heavenly income, and not your earthly account. Favor can grant you that, which your earthly account could never afford.</p>
		  	<p>I can confidently declare that I will never be homeless, not because I have got a good job, but because I have a fat spiritual account, where I make unlimited withdrawals.</p>
		  	<p>Let your earthly account conform to your heavenly account, and not vice-versa. Set your hope on what God can give, and not what your account can afford. Be blessed!</p>
