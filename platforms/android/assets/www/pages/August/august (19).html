		  	<p><i>Are not two sparrows sold for a penny? And not one of them will fall to the ground apart from your Father. But even the hairs of your head are all numbered. Fear not, therefore; you are of more value than many sparrows. (Matthew 10:29-31)</i></p>


		  	<blockquote>When a man realizes how much value God has placed on him, his attitude to life changes for good.</blockquote>

		  	<p>When a man realizes how much value God has placed on him, his attitude to life changes for good.</p>
		  	<p>So many times, we complain, worry, get anxious, and struggle, simply because we don’t understand our worth. A life of ease only begins when we realize how valuable we are to God.</p>
		  	<p>As cheap as the sparrows are, God has His eyes on them; He will not let any of them fall to the ground. If God is so concerned about the affairs of the sparrows, how much more will he be concerned about your affairs?</p>
		  	<p>If God will not let the sparrows fall, He’d surely not let you down as well; If God will not let the sparrows starve, He’d constantly provide even more for you. If God gives shelter to the sparrows, He will not leave you homeless.</p>
		  	<p>You are so valuable to God that He will not withhold anything good from you.</p>
		  	<p>You are much more valuable than many sparrows; you are the most valued of God’s creatures. He created so many things, but only man did He make in His own image.</p>
		  	<p>Why then should you harbor fear, when God has promised that He will never let you down? Why then should you worry when God is the one in charge of your case?</p>
		  	<p>Bishop TD Jakes once elaborated this line, <i> “But even the hairs of your head are all numbered.” </i> He explained the difference between the hairs of our hair being counted, and it being numbered.</p>
		  	<p>Not only have our hairs been counted, but numbered. Therefore, when hair number ninety turns white, God knows. There is a number affixed to every strand of hair on our head; that’s just a reflection of how much God values us.</p>
		  	<p>God values you much more than you can imagine; He is more concerned about your success than you are.</p>
		  	<p>Beloved, from Today, develop a sense of self-worth; never walk without the consciousness of how valuable you are to God. When you understand how valuable you are, you will cease to live an average life. Be blessed.</p>
