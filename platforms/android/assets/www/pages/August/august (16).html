		  	<p><i>To the angel of the church in Sardis write:</i></p>
		  	<p><i>These are the words of him who holds the seven spirits of God and the seven stars. I know your deeds; you have a reputation of being alive, but you are dead. (Revelations 3:1 NIV)</i></p>

		  	<blockquote>The body could be reputable before men, but the life, frail before God. </blockquote>

		  	<p>This was a letter specifically addressed to the church;</p>
		  	<p>Meditating intently on these lines, I realized something true: it is possible for a church to have that reputation and name of being alive, but actually be dead in the sight of God. Some versions quote, “people say that you are alive, but in reality you are dead.”</p>
		  	<p>It’s crazy how the places we hold in high esteem, and regard as being very reputable might be seen as dead in the sight of God. It is better for a dead body, organization or institution to be regarded as dead; then the members will know that they really need to wake up! But it is a terrible thing to relax, with folded arms, in the comfort of your death, thinking that you are alive.</p>
		  	<p>Here’s a perfect illustration: Solomon was made to judge between a certain scenario of two prostitutes, each claiming to be the mother of a living child, and declaiming the dead. (1 Kings 3:16-28)</p>
		  	<p>One of the prostitutes had slept on her child, and killed him; on discovery of her mistake, she quickly swapped her baby with the living baby of another prostitute, while she was yet asleep.</p>
		  	<p>I recall that after a swap of babies had been done, the genuine mother of the living child kept sleeping beside the corpse of the other prostitutes’ child, without realizing the exchange, until she woke up in the morning.</p>
		  	<p>At first I thought—that’s quite unlike a mother; she should have noticed when her child was swapped with a dead one; but on a second thought, I realized that it was not so much of her fault; there was a body next to her.</p>
		  	<p>She must have stretched her hands severally in her sleep, and touched her baby to be sure he’s ok. As long as a body was there for her to touch, it was difficult to observe that there was no life in that body. It took her waking up, and taking a close view at the body, to realize that the life was gone.</p>
		  	<p>Likewise, the presence of the body always gives a feeling that there is life in there, but it is not until you wake up, that you can observe the real state of your child.</p>
		  	<p>That church, organization, institution or ministry might have the reputation of being alive, because the body is still present; but understand that until you are awake, you can never know its real state. The message goes on:</p>
		  	<p><i>Wake up! Strengthen what remains and is about to die, for I have found your deeds unfinished in the sight of my God. (Revelations 3:2 NIV)</i></p>
		  	<p>Verily, there is a wakeup call; if you define your steps based on the judgments of men, you will not know your real state; men could regard you as being alive, when God sees you as dead, and vice versa.</p>
		  	<p>Therefore beloved, our utmost concern should be how God regards us and our works. The fact that there is a body, which has existed for years, does not guarantee life. The body could be reputable before men, but the life, frail before God.</p>
		  	<p>Much more than you should be concerned about how everyone regards and esteems you, be concerned about what your state is, in the sight of God. Be blessed!</p>
