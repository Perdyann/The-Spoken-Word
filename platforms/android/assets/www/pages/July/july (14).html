		  	<p><i>Therefore [even] when He heard that Lazarus was sick, He still stayed two days longer in the same place where He was. (John 11:6)</i></p>

		  	<blockquote>Jesus withheld healing from Lazarus because healing was not good enough for him, resurrection was! </blockquote>

		  	<p>There is always a purpose for every delay; as it is said, delay is not denial. The fact that your promise has tarried, does not mean that it will not come to pass. In seasons when things are delayed longer than necessary, we just need to trust God, and hold on.</p>
		  	<p>The presence of Jesus was expected at Judea immediately the message of Lazarus illness was passed on to Him, however, He tarried for two days longer. Reading carefully through the scripture, we realize that ordinarily, Jesus might have departed His current city, but for the sake of Lazarus sickness, He chose to delay.</p>
		  	<p>Jesus did not just choose to stay back for two more days, there was a purpose. Even though he knew that he could leave immediately, he chose to delay for the sake of everyone else.</p>
		  	<p>They had seen Jesus heal the sick before, yet did not believe; but the resurrection of a dead man was able to win them over. The sole purpose of Jesus delay is defined in his statement after the death of Lazarus.</p>
		  	<p><i>And for your sake I am glad that I was not there; it will help you to believe (to trust and rely on Me). However, let us go to him. (John 11:15)</i></p>
		  	<p>By this statement, he implied that his absence was intentional, and the purpose was great. Indeed that purpose was fulfilled, because it is recorded that after the resurrection of Lazarus, many believed.</p>
		  	<p>Likewise beloved, the absence of your desire now does not mean that it will be denied. Be informed that God has delayed a lot of things in life for your good. God will never withhold anything good from us; therefore, if God has withheld anything from you, it means that it is not good enough for you.</p>
		  	<p>Jesus withheld healing from Lazarus because healing was not good enough for him, resurrection was!</p>
		  	<p>God knows exactly what’s best for us. He knows when healing is needed, and when resurrection is; he knows when rent is needed, and when a house is.</p>
		  	<p>There is a reason for the delay; your desired job might have tarried because God wants you to be an employer not an employee. That’s just how He wanted Lazarus to be the raised, and not the healed.</p>
		  	<p>There is a purpose for every delay; there is timing for everything; there is a time affixed to every promise and blessing. We only need to train our spirit to learn to trust and hold on to the Word of God.</p>
		  	<p>Though it tarries, it will surely come to pass. Be blessed!</p>
