		  	<p><i>So then faith cometh by hearing, and hearing by the word of God. (Romans 10:17)</i></p>
		  	

		  	<blockquote>Fear originates from the world, but Faith originates from the Word. Spend more time in the Word than you spend in the world.</blockquote>

		  	<p>The origin of faith is the Word of God. When a man lacks knowledge of God’s Word, it is impossible for him to have faith, no matter how much he prays for it.</p>
		  	<p>Kenneth Hagin quoted, “You cannot believe beyond your actual knowledge of God’s Word.” Verily, the extent of your faith is weighed in accordance with the level of God’s Word in your Spirit. A man, whose spirit has not absorbed God’s Word, can never act faith.</p>
		  	<p>The sole origin of faith is the Word of God. When we are admonished in the scripture to grow in faith, we are simply expected to meditate and increase our knowledge in the Word of God. When your knowledge of God’s Word increases, your faith increases, thus, nothing remains impossible.</p>
		  	<p>If I had not studied the resurrection of Lazarus, Tabitha, and others, I might never have believed that the dead could rise. If I had not studied about Ezekiel and the valley of dry bones, I might never have believed that God could breathe hope on hopeless situations.</p>
		  	<p>Time and space will not permit me to clearly write down all the scriptures that stirred me up and stretched my faith. I will never have faith as much as I do if I had never encountered the Word of God.</p>
		  	<p>Here’s the point brethren, you need to stop praying to God to give you faith; it doesn’t work that way. God will never pour down faith from heaven into the heart of a man, who lacks knowledge of His Word. God has revealed the origin of faith; if you need faith, go to its origin—The Word of God. </p>
		  	<p>Without faith, you will easily be swung in all directions by mild winds; without faith, you will easily be defeated by the minutest trial; you need faith to remain standing when the ferocious storms of life, roar against you.</p>
		  	<p>A Christian has a measure of faith already, but that is not enough; a mustard seed is characterized by its massive growth, despite its initial size. Likewise, your faith must be grown beyond the initial measure.</p>
		  	<p>Without faith, it remains impossible to please God; seeing then that the origin of faith is the Word of God, we can easily conclude that without constant meditation on God’s Word, it remains impossible to please Him.</p>
		  	<p>Don’t look for faith elsewhere; it originates from the Word of God. The Sunday to Sunday service sermons are not enough to increase your faith to a mountain moving level; you need to devote your time to receiving Rhema from God’s Word constantly.</p>
		  	<p>Fear originates from the world, but Faith originates from the Word. Spend more time in the Word than you spend in the world. Be blessed!</p>
