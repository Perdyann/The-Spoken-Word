		  	<p><i>Sojourn in this land, and I will be with thee, and will bless thee; for unto thee, and unto thy seed, I will give all these countries, and I will perform the oath which I sware unto Abraham thy father;</i></p>
		  	<p><i>And I will make thy seed to multiply as the stars of heaven, and will give unto thy seed all these countries; and in thy seed shall all the nations of the earth be blessed;</i></p>
		  	<p><i>Because that Abraham obeyed my voice, and kept my charge, my commandments, my statutes, and my laws. (Genesis 26:3-5)</i></p>

		  	<blockquote>Great empires, wealth, and properties will perish when the earth passes away, but the best legacies of many virtues (goodly heritage), outlives time.</blockquote>

		  	<p>At the mention of the word, legacy, the first thought most people have is that of earthly inheritance, wealth and properties. Verily, there is a godly and a kingdom legacy which is more valuable than all these. It is a legacy of faith, mercy and virtues.</p>
		  	<p>Much more than we should desire to leave a heritage of great wealth for our generations to come, we should be focused on leaving a goodly heritage.</p>
		  	<p>Abraham was a tried and proven man of faith. God blessed him richly; amazingly, years after he had died, when there was a famine, God extended the blessing of Abraham to his seed (Isaac). The reason being, ‘Because that Abraham obeyed.’ Verily beloved, you can store up enough blessings and mercy for your seed, by your acts of obedience and faithful service to God.</p>
		  	<p>The flow of virtues through generations did not stop there. Saul was a king anointed by God, but he chose to live contrary to his call, he was soaked in iniquity. However, Jonathan, his son, chose not to follow his father’s footsteps, but to stand for truth.</p>
		  	<p><i>And David said unto him, Fear not: for I will surely shew thee kindness for Jonathan thy father’s sake, and will restore thee all the land of Saul thy father; and thou shalt eat bread at my table continually. (2 Samuel 9:7)</i></p>
		  	<p>Jonathan’s decision to stand for truth despite his father’s acts extended mercy, favor and blessings to his son, Mephibosheth. Beloved, in years to come, will your seed ever be blessed and favored for your sake?</p>
		  	<p>Furthermore, studying 1 Kings 11, you will realize that years after David, the man after God’s heart, had passed on, Solomon his son disobeyed God to the extent that God would have taken the kingdom from him, but for his Father’s sake, God showed mercy.</p>
		  	<p>The legacy of mercy, which David had stored up, was further extended even to Jeroboam, Hezekiah and many others.</p>
		  	<p>Beloved, by the choices and decisions we make today, we can impact the generations to come. Much more than we make deposits of wealth for them to inherit, we can choose to make deposits of mercy, blessings and favor that will extend to them in years to come.</p>
		  	<p>Paul said something very remarkable to Timothy:</p>
		  	<p><i>When I call to remembrance the unfeigned faith that is in thee, which dwelt first in thy grandmother Lois, and thy mother Eunice; and I am persuaded that in thee also. (2 Timothy 1:5)</i></p>
		  	<p>Verily, virtues of faith flowed from his grandmother Lois, through his mother Eunice, and down to him. Beloved, virtues could be passed down through generations.</p>
		  	<p>We have heard of generational curses, in the same way, we also have generational blessings. Even if your background is not so good, you can choose to be the first to break out of your evil background, and start a new generation of blessings.</p>
		  	<p>Jesus did not ascend from the earth without leaving a legacy. We have life, remission of sins, health and prosperity today because Jesus paid the master price.</p>
		  	<p>Beloved, just like Jesus, Abraham, David, and others, paid the price, to leave a legacy for us. We can choose to live a life that will extend blessings, favor and mercy down to our generations to come.</p>
		  	<p>I’m not surprised the Psalmist could declare:</p>
		  	<p><i>The lines are fallen unto me in pleasant places; yea, I have a goodly heritage. (Psalms 16:6)</i></p>
		  	<p>His reason for making such a bold declaration is stated: <i> I have a goodly heritage. </i> Think on this today — What legacy are you leaving behind?</p>
		  	<p>Great empires, wealth, and properties will perish when the earth passes away, but the best legacies of many virtues (goodly heritage), outlives time. Be blessed!</p>
