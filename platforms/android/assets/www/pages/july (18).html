		  	<p><i>Though he fall, he shall not be utterly cast down: for the LORD upholdeth him with his hand. (Psalms 37:24)</i></p>
		 

		  	<blockquote>Mistakes are not amended by a step backward, but a step forward. Your future will amend your mistakes better than your past can.</blockquote>

		  	<p>All men have fallen! All men have made mistakes! At some point, our steps might have been ordered by our feelings, and not the Holy Ghost.</p>
		  	<p>There are actions we have made in life, which we now deeply regret. We all wish we had done things better at some point, sometimes we think, “If I had not spoken that way, I may not have fallen.”</p>
		  	<p>It is a great thing to realize that we have made mistakes, and to be determined to do things better next time; it is good to know that most of us have learnt one or more lessons from our previous mistakes.</p>
		  	<p>However, if you are not careful, you might be led wrongly by those mistakes.</p>
		  	<p>Many have asked, “In what ways, can I correct my mistakes, and clear off my regrets ...”</p>
		  	<p>The regret of previous mistakes hurts so bad; many are tormented by the wrong things they did, which they wished, they never did. The topic of handling mistakes is a very sensitive one; many people have attempted re-visiting their pasts, in order to correct the mistakes they previously made.</p>
		  	<p>The truth, which they fail to realize, is that mistakes are not amended by a step backward, but a step forward. You cannot prevent yourself from falling, by re-visiting the place you fell.</p>
		  	<p>When everyone has a bad impression about you, because of what you did in the past; despite the fact that you are changed now, and you deeply regret your previous deeds. Do you keep thinking about your past mistakes, or do you embrace the challenge of living greater than your past?</p>
		  	<p>The best way to prove to people that you’re changed, is not by revisiting your past, but by rising up from the place you fell, shaking off yourself, and living better.</p>
		  	<p>Paul went through a similar stage; he was known to be a persecutor of the church. Even after his conversion, people still doubted his credibility. He did not need to revisit his past in order to make up for his mistakes; rather, he focused on building himself to be better than his past, and that was the only prove everyone needed.</p>
		  	<p>Never let your mistakes rule over you; if Paul was not careful, he might have been too concerned about the criticisms directed towards him, that he wouldn’t be able to live up to his calling.</p>
		  	<p>However, as he kept the focus, and gradually grew in knowledge of the Lord; people saw the light of God in him, and were convinced with time that he is for real.</p>
		  	<p>Here’s the point, the correction to your mistake is not behind you, but ahead of you. Your future will amend your mistakes better than your past can. As the scripture rightly states, although you might have fallen, you will not be utterly cast down, for the Lord upholds you.</p>
		  	<p>Although we might have made mistakes in the past, although we may have regrets . . . we are not condemned. The Lord upholds us; get ready, because out of your mistakes, the Lord will birth a miracle.</p>
		  	<p>Don’t be cast down by your mistakes; be held up high, by the hand of the Lord. Your miracle is on the way. Be blessed!</p>
