		  	<p><i>And Miriam and Aaron spake against Moses because of the Ethiopian woman whom he had married: for he had married an Ethiopian woman. And the cloud departed from off the tabernacle; and, behold, Miriam became leprous, white as snow: and Aaron looked upon Miriam, and, behold, she was leprous. (Numbers 12:1&10)</i></p>
		  	
		  	<blockquote>As a man of covenant, there are some battles you don’t need to fight.</blockquote>

		  	<p>Men of covenant do not take actions to avenge for themselves; covenant speaks on their behalf.</p>
		  	<p>Miriam and Aaron spoke against Moses behind him; it is amazing to fathom that Moses had no idea of what they said about him; But God took it upon Himself, to act against them on his behalf.</p>
		  	<p>Miriam became a leper, for speaking against a man of covenant. Moses did not need to engage in any fight against the duo, but covenant put his conspirators where they belonged. Likewise, some battles are not ours to fight, but of covenant to act.</p>
		  	<p>Those who blessed him were blessed and those who cursed him were automatically cursed, not because he made personal efforts to subdue them, but because covenant never ceased to act on his behalf.</p>
		  	<p>There is a covenant that speaks for me! Much more than you pay attention to your enemies and haters, focus on the covenant that speaks for you. As a man of covenant, there are some battles you don’t need to fight. It is written:</p>
		  	<p><i>“Gather to me my faithful ones, who made a covenant with me by sacrifice!” (Psalms 50:5)</i></p>
		  	<p>When you are a man of covenant, God is constantly on your case; He holds you close, and in high esteem; He gives you favor that no one else has; He makes your fight his own.</p>
		  	<p>Beloved, the fight is no longer ours’ to engage in, but that of covenant.</p>
		  	<p>The conversation between Miriam and Aaron was private, and no one else heard of it, but God. What Moses could not hear for himself, covenant heard. Likewise, even the conspiracies we are not aware of, covenant is.</p>
		  	<p>The only issue is that many have placed themselves in a position to bear a burden that is not meant for them.</p>
		  	<p>Men, who constantly try to subdue their enemies, are those, who are not aware of their covenant rights. When you are a man of covenant, covenant subdues your enemies on your behalf.</p>
		  	<p>Those who blessed Abraham were blessed, and those who cursed him were cursed, not because he made attempts to bless or curse anyone, but because covenant recognized those fellows, and gave them what they deserved. It was automatic!</p>
		  	<p>The very second Miriam uttered a word against Moses, she received a curse! Be careful the words you speak and actions you take against people, whose covenant you cannot fathom. Be blessed!</p>
