		  	<p><i>The steadfast love of the Lord never ceases; his mercies never come to an end; they are new every morning; great is your faithfulness. (Lamentations 3:22-23 ESV)</i></p>


		  	<blockquote>When worrying about your future steals your joy, quit worrying! Your future has been established already, every new day just draws you closer to it. </blockquote>

		  	<p>It is interesting to understand that God’s mercies, love, faithfulness, kindness and provision are new every morning. In essence, every new day ushers in a package of God’s new blessings.</p>
		  	<p>Little wonder we are admonished by the scriptures to be anxious for nothing. Don’t think about how you are going to sort out some bills by the end of the month, don’t think about how you’re going to cope with your responsibilities for the next couple of years. God’s mercies, provision, and love is new every morning.</p>
		  	<p>God gives us strength for every new day; you don’t need to be worried about not having enough strength for tomorrow.</p>
		  	<p>Before you go to bed at night, you might be worried about your feeding the next day; however, this Word gives us an assurance that every new day has its own blessings. Therefore, the provision needed for tomorrow will be made available in the morning.</p>
		  	<p>Sometime ago, back in Nigeria, I found it quite difficult to secure admission into any of the Universities. The worst aspect of it was that there was basically only one intake in a year; therefore, being denied admission implies you having to wait for another year.</p>
		  	<p>I felt very sad each time I was denied admission, because I knew I will have to wait another year. Each day seemed like a year on its own, and I couldn’t imagine waiting as long as the span of another year.</p>
		  	<p>More saddening was the fact that I was not even guaranteed the admission the next year. In essence, I am not just waiting for a year, but perhaps some years.</p>
		  	<p>The problem was not waiting another year, but being uncertain when the waiting will end.</p>
		  	<p>I had been in my situation for too long; if I was guaranteed that I’d be admitted in a year, then I will gladly wait, but being uncertain about when the situation will end, got me depressed.</p>
		  	<p>I had enough strength to have endured it for some years, and possibly endure the coming year, but felt weak to imagine waiting any longer than that.</p>
		  	<p>This feeling was only birthed because of my level of understanding then. Verily, I expected God to give me the strength to wait for one or more years, but what God did was to give me strength for every new day.</p>
		  	<p>I endured waiting day after day, and felt okay; my only pain was the uncertainty of when the waiting will end. But as God gave me strength, mercies and grace every new day, I waited for years without even realizing it. Before I could figure out how long I had waited, God’s time for me to proceed with studies had arrived. What am I saying brethren?</p>
		  	<p>When worrying about your future steals your joy, quit worrying! God has got your whole life written out before now. Your future has been established already, every new day just draws you closer to it.</p>
		  	<p>It is written: <i> “Therefore do not be anxious about tomorrow, for tomorrow will be anxious for itself. Sufficient for the day is its own trouble.” (Matthew 6:34) </i></p>
		  	<p>Just as everyday has its own troubles, everyday has its own blessings. The blessing of each day helps us to overcome the troubles of that day. Don’t try to drag tomorrow’s problems into this day; focus on living the best out of this day, and the strength for tomorrow will be given to thee when morning arrives. Be blessed!</p>
