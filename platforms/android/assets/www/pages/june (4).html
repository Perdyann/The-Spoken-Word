		  	<p><i>Such confidence we have through Christ before God. Not that we are competent in ourselves to claim anything for ourselves, but our competence comes from God. He has made us competent as ministers of a new covenant—not of the letter but of the Spirit; for the letter kills, but the Spirit gives life. (2 Corinthians 3:4-6 NIV)</i></p>


		  	<blockquote>If your confidence is not from God, your victory is not guaranteed yet. </blockquote>

		  	<p>I am very confident that there is nothing I cannot do; I am very confident that God will complete the good work He has begun in my life; I am very confident that there is no trial and temptation beyond my ability to overcome; and just like David to Goliath, I am very confident that there is no giant I cannot defeat.</p>
		  	<p>I might have lost many things in the past, but this mindset is something I am never willing to let go of. I always encourage everyone around me to be confident.</p>
		  	<p>Confidence is a virtue; When a CV (Curriculum vitae) is being analyzed, one of the moods of the writer, greatly searched for is confidence; when an interview is being done for a position, one of the things employers look out for in their prospective employee’s is confidence. Before anyone would be willing to welcome you into his circle of affairs, your confidence has got to speak for you.</p>
		  	<p>Before David slung a stone at Goliath, his confidence spoke; he was so convinced that he could defeat and behead Goliath.</p>
		  	<p>Every act of confidence must have a source; the source of David’s confidence was his Faith in God. That’s not the case of many others.</p>
		  	<p>Some men put their trust in fellow men; some men are sure that they will obtain higher positions through earthly connections; the confidence of some others rest in their physical strength and ability.</p>
		  	<p>Notice that Goliath was quite as confident as David was; he did not see David as a threat, but child’s play; he mocked the Israelites for presenting before him, someone of such little physique.</p>
		  	<p>Verily, the difference between the duo was not confidence, but the source of their confidence. While David’s confidence was from God, Goliath’s confidence was from his physical muscles and gigantic physique.</p>
		  	<p>Beloved, if your confidence is not from God, your victory is not guaranteed yet.</p>
		  	<p>Reading through the scripture reference for today, we see that Paul boldly declared that his confidence is from nowhere else but God. He further states, but our competence comes from God.</p>
		  	<p>He admitted that his only qualification, ability, and strength comes from God; of our own strength, we are not capable, but in God, we are confident that there is nothing too big for us to achieve.</p>
		  	<p>Beloved, never cease to be confident in God; what you cannot achieve in your greatest strength, with your biggest resources, and with the best connections; you can achieve it all in God. He is the source of our confidence. Be blessed!</p>
