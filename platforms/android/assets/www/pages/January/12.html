		  <div class="panel-body" style="text-align:justify">

		  	<p><i>Remember [earnestly] also your Creator [that you are not your own, but His property now] in the days of your youth, before the evil days come or the years draw near when you will say [of physical pleasures], I have no enjoyment in them—(Ecclesiastes 12:1 AMP)</i></p>


		  	<blockquote>Develop strategies that your mates have not thought of. Build capacities that your mates have not dared to build. You are young for a purpose, don’t let it go unfulfilled.</blockquote>

		  	<p>Earnestly, from the depth of your heart, not out of compulsion . . . this is the most effective season of your life. It is the best time to serve God!</p>
		  	<p>If you cannot serve God in your youth, you might not be able to do that as the years draw near. So much is yet to take your attention . . . Here’s the time to be devoted to God, and to order your days ahead.</p>
		  	<p>Over years, people have grown various perceptions towards youthfulness . . . Most times, these perceptions are indeed deceptions; they deceive you into thinking that the youthful age is the season to be worldly, and explore all heights of what they describe as ‘fun’.</p>
		  	<p>A lot of people have approached me in like manner, and when they observed I had a different attitude and perspective of being a youth, they tried to talk me into seeing reasons with them saying, “C’mon Zuriel, you’ve got to live your age . . .” I really don’t know what life there is outside of God . . . I really can’t understand what else could be of much fun than the presence of my Father.</p>
		  	<p>The truth which many fail to understand is what I call the making of great men . . . Great men don’t just live their age, they go a step further! Great men are men who have risen to do things which their mates have not thought of doing! Great men are those who don’t just strive to make a living, but to make a difference. Indeed, the world has seen great men, and admitted to their greatness, but the wrong perception emanates from categorization.</p>
		  	<p>Greatness is often reflected in much elderly people . . . Not as many young people have written books as old men have. Not many have recorded great things in their youth. The truth is that you can be young and serve the Lord . . . You can be young and re-write the records . . . You can be young and be focused. People often procrastinate. They leave the Work of the Father till their old age, and retirement.</p>
		  	<p>Sometime ago, a friend said to me, “I’ve got to live my life and have fun like every normal youth is doing”. These very words have been banned from my vocabulary and mindset.</p>
		  	<p>I refuse to be normal . . . I refuse to think ordinary. If you do what everyone else is doing, you’d only end up like everyone else. The era where the world embraced commonalities is over . . . The world is in dire need of difference. Many PhD holders, authors, architects, bankers etc have emerged, but those who outshine others are those who went an extra mile to produce an uncommon result.</p>
		  	<p>Even as a youth, when you operate from your physical abilities, you only produce common and ordinary results, but when you operate from your deposit of grace you produce uncommon results, as such men cannot help but wonder, “What manner of man is this?”</p>
		  	<p>I am therefore not surprised when the bible says, <i> “seeth a man that’s diligent in his work, he will stand before kings and not mere men.” (Proverbs 22:29).</i> This states a level of discrimination, and categorization of men . . . . We have the <b><i>Royals (Kings)</i></b>, and we have the <b><i>mere men</i></b>. Determine not to be “mere” Stand out!</p>
		  	<p>Develop strategies that your mates have not thought of . . . build capacities that your mates have not dared to build . . . Don’t look at yourself as being too young. You are young for a purpose, don’t let it go unfulfilled. Stand out from every other youth, and do something different.</p>
		  	<p>I once heard someone say, “When an old man gives his life to Christ, a soul is saved, but when a young man gets saved, a generation is saved.” This is the best time to stand out, for the sake of your generation! More grace!</p>
