		  	<p><i>And he spake a parable unto them to this end, that men ought always to pray, and not to faint;
			Saying, There was in a city a judge, which feared not God, neither regarded man:</i></p>
		  	<p><i>And there was a widow in that city; and she came unto him, saying, Avenge me of mine adversary.</i></p>
		  	<p><i>And he would not for a while: but afterward he said within himself, Though I fear not God, nor regard man;</i></p>
		  	<p><i>Yet because this widow troubleth me, I will avenge her, lest by her continual 
			coming she weary me. (Luke 18:1-5)</i></p>


		  	<blockquote>In tough times, and trying situations, the change is only brought about by your conscious decision to persevere against all odds.</blockquote>

		  	<p>Have you aimed at achieving success in a particular field for a while, yet you encounter difficulties and oppositions that hinder and delay your course? What you need to do is to persevere! Here’s a widow, who simply needed justice for her adversaries, and before her is a Judge with no regard for God or man. Such people are very tough to handle, and the case of the widow was not an exception.</p>
		  	<p>He tried to handle her with toughness, and make her experience difficulties, such that she will be wearied with no other alternative than to give up. Even so, this lady was not willing to let go . . . She stood on her grounds, and persevered, until the Judge got weary of her troubles and sorted her out.</p>
		  	<p>This passage gives light to the truth that by perseverance, you could win a case that was deemed to be lost. Perseverance could birth an array of hope in the most hopeless situation. Verily, there must have been other widows who troubled the Judge for similar issues, but gave up their situation, seeing the meanness of such a Judge.</p>
		  	<p>Such widows had their cases as good as lost. But this widow was singled out to re-write the story. Her instance portrays the truth that perseverance could always cause a positive change to the end result, no matter how little.</p>
		  	<p>In tough times, and trying situations, the change is only brought about by your conscious decision to persevere against all odds. You might have been through a lot lately, the trial might only be getting tougher by the days, and your chances of scaling through are only getting slimmer . . . Bear this in mind, by your deliberate decision to persevere; even the toughest Judge might be propelled to favor you!</p>
		  	<p>Jesus gave this parable to the end that men ought always to pray. Here’s your Word for today: Persevere in prayers . . . Persevere in hard work . . . Persevere with hope. For your continuance in a state of grace will eventually lead to a final state of glory. It’s too early to give up . . . It’s too early to turn back . . . Persevere!</p>
