		  	<p><i>For not he that commendeth himself is approved, but whom the Lord commendeth. (2 Corinthians 10:18)</i></p>
		  


		  	<blockquote>The way to measure your stand is not by the appraisals of men; neither is it by your level of fame; for some who meet these standards, are still not qualified in the eyes of God.</blockquote>

		  	<p>If there’s one thing which we should constantly do, it’s definitely to check our stand in the Spirit. It is important to know and discover your stand in God.</p>
		  	<p>So often, men praise you, everyone thinks you’re doing the best thing, you think you’re in the best place, but indeed God is not pleased with your deeds.</p>
		  	<p>The bible says, <i>“There is a way which seemeth right unto a man, but the end thereof are the ways of death.” (Proverbs 14:12).</i></p>
		  	<p>Sometime ago, the Lord particularly revealed to me that many Ministers and men of God are not walking in his ways . . . He made me to understand that many amongst these are Mega bishops whom the whole world praises.</p>
		  	<p>He opened my eyes to envisage the last day, when many will come to Him saying, “Did we not cast out demons and heal the sick in your name”, and He will cast them out with a reply, “depart from me sons of iniquity, I know ye not.” (Matthew 7:22-23).</p>
		  	<p>Like never before, this revelation made me conscious of every step I take. My eyes were opened to the reality that it is not he, who commends himself that is approved; but he, whom the Lord approves.</p>
		  	<p>The way to measure your stand is not by the appraisals of men; neither is it by your level of fame; for some who meet these standards, are still not qualified in the eyes of God. Let not the desire for fame, fortune and the love from all men make you to compromise your stand in God, for that’s what matters most.</p>
		  	<p>You may be the most achieved . . . you may heal the sick . . . you may have great influence . . . you may have many fans . . . men may praise you always . . . But there is a level of pride in you that God wants to deal with. It’s this pride that makes you to think that you are your own creator; it propels you to believe that you know everything, and sometimes you neglect the instruction of God and act based on your will.</p>
		  	<p>Even so, men cannot see this, and so they even love you more. Have you ever wondered what you look like in the eyes of God? That’s what counts most.</p>
		  	<p>This does not apply to Ministers alone, but to everyone who thinks he’s something, meanwhile, God thinks of you differently. Do not think of yourself more highly than you ought to. (Romans 12:3)</p>
		  	<p>The bible says, <i> “Wherefore let him that thinketh he standeth take heed lest he fall.” (1 Corinthians 10:12).</i> It’s very pathetic to think that you’ve been serving God all your live, but in the eyes of God, your service is to self and not Him.</p>
		  	<p>Beloved, this is one thing you must imbibe today . . . Learn to view yourself from the eyes of God, and not just man. Some people have been made to believe that they are nothing, and their efforts don’t count a bit . . . men have made some others to believe that they are not good enough, but indeed, these may be the fellows with whom the Lord is well pleased.</p>
		  	<p>Don’t let men define you . . . be defined by God. It is written, <i>“Who art thou that judgest another man’s servant? to his own master he standeth or falleth . . .” (Romans 14:4). </i> God has a special purpose for you; don’t give men the room to ruin it.</p>
		  	<p>If it was left to Samuel to choose, he would have anointed Eliab (The eldest son of Jesse), because David (the youngest son) did not seem fit in statue, neither did he seem like a good choice in the eyes of men.</p>
		  	<p>Amazingly, in the eyes of God, it was different . . . David was the man after God’s own heart . . . He was indeed the best candidate!</p>
		  	<p>Men will always try to make you believe that you are not a good choice for what God has called you to be, but remember this—it is God who does the choosing. Don’t let your purpose be terminated by the choice of men. View yourself from the eyes of God. Be blessed!</p>
