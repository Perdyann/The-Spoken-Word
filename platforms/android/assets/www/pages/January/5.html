		  	<p><i>And the king of Sodom said to Abram, Give me the persons and keep the goods for yourself.</i></p>
		  	<p><i>But Abram said to the king of Sodom, I have lifted up my hand and sworn to the Lord, God Most High, the Possessor and Maker of heaven and earth,</i></p>
		  	<p><i>That I would not take a thread or a shoelace or anything that is yours, lest you should say, I have made Abram rich. (Genesis 14:21-23)</i></p>
		 


		  	<blockquote> Verily, your destiny may have links to individuals, but most verily, it’s never in the hand of any man. No man has the capacity to carry your own destiny! </blockquote>

		  	<p>So often, when the Lord gives a Word in a season, when the possibility of anything is doubted, we may begin to use our human reasoning to evaluate its possibility. It is like an instance where God tells a man who is hardly able to feed, that he will be a billionaire in a couple of months.</p>
		  	<p>At this juncture, the poor man will start by an evaluation of how far his pennies could go in investment . . . And this may determine how strong his faith will be in reception of God’s Word.</p>
		  	<p>In this particular instance, Abram had left his Father land without anything but a Word from God that assured him of greatness. Isn’t it amazing how Abram held unto this Word even when it didn’t seem likely to be fulfilled (majorly considering the fact that he had no son)?</p>
		  	<p>At this place where Abraham stood, every offer may have seemed like an opportunity to have the Word fulfilled, but it’s really perplexing the way Abraham rejected the offer from the King of Sodom.</p>
		  	<p>A man of senses might have thought, “this is the only chance and opportunity I’ve been waiting for . . .” but Abraham said no! Just for one reason— <i>“That you may never be able to say that you’ve made Abram rich”</i></p>
		  	<p>Verily, your destiny may have links to individuals, but most verily, it’s never in the hand of any man. As long as God leads you, you are sure of excellence. Abram was a man of the Spirit, he could discern the mind and thought of God about his purpose.</p>
		  	<p>So many times, even in ministry,—not every offer is an opportunity. So often, rich donations may be made to Servants of God, but it’s not always to be accepted. There are times when God deliberately instructs, “take nothing”.</p>
		  	<p>Many Servants of God, of their own accord may have genuine reasons to receive it . . . They may want to invest it in the expansion of God’s Kingdom, but never forget this, acknowledge the Lord before any step. Be careful to be led by the Spirit and not your human senses.</p>
		  	<p>Think of Saul, God gave an instruction, for them to destroy everything. (The whole of Amalek), and take nothing away; but they took gold, rams and other goods (not for himself) but for sacrifice.</p>
		  	<p>His original intention was to please God, but he failed to realize that pleasing God is impossible for those who deliberately neglect God’s instructions. As a result, that sacrifice, rather than pleasing God, drove Saul out of his office.</p>
		  	<p>Abram knew that his destiny is in the hands of God alone! Only God can do and undo. No man has the capacity to carry your own destiny! Abraham trusted the Word of God to the extent of believing that even without the wealth of the King of Sodom, he’d still be the father of all nations. He wanted to walk in a way that will glorify God alone.</p>
		  	<p>No man can lead you like the Holy Spirit. Did you notice that after Abraham had taken that bold step of rejecting anything that could thwart the glory of God, the Word of the Lord came to him saying, <i>“Fear not, Abram, I am your Shield, your abundant compensation, and your reward shall be exceedingly great.” (Genesis 15:1)</i></p>
		  	<p>Learn to set your focus on God and not the means or men. It doesn’t matter how God is going to do it, all I am concerned about is the end result, which is the fulfillment of the Word. Amen!</p>
