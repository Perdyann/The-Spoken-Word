		  	<p><i>But God hath chosen the foolish things of the world to confound the wise; and God hath chosen the weak things of the world to confound the things which are mighty;</i></p>
		  	<p><i>And base things of the world, and things which are despised, hath God chosen, yea, and things which are not, to bring to nought things that are: (1 Corinthians 1:27-28)</i></p>


		  	<blockquote>The worst mistake you could ever make in Life is tagging God with a means of coming to your need – you’d surely miss out.</blockquote>

		  	<p>It’s amazing the people God uses... He doesn’t choose the qualified, but qualifies the chosen . . . When He needs to get a mighty task done, He might choose the most foolish person, and make wisdom out of him. That’s just the way the Father is . . .</p>
		  	<p>We hear of the feeding of the 5000 always, but not many get to comprehend that 5000 is the number of men alone. Women and Kids were not included in that number. Now, greater to fathom is the truth that when God needed to feed this crowd, of all people to use, He uses a lad (someone who wasn’t even counted)</p>
		  	<p>Furthermore, when God needed to feed His servant Elijah during the famine, he uses a poor widow, who only had her last. Have you ever wondered why he didn’t use the rich people who had food excessively, or who at least had a weeks’ food stored up in their bans? Even though the Widow had nothing, God chose to make something great out of the least she could have. That’s just the way the Father is...</p>
		  	<p>If there’s one thing I’ve learnt over time—Never tag God with a means or method, for He isn’t always predictable. You may be used to God blessing your finances through a wealthy relative of yours’; now, when you’ve prayed and asked God for financial blessings, don’t always expect him to use that your wealthy relative; if He decides to provide via a different means, and you’re not sensitive to that, you might miss out.</p>
		  	<p><i>And I will raise me up a faithful priest, that shall do according to that which is in mine heart and in my mind: and I will build him a sure house; and he shall walk before mine anointed for ever. (1 Samuel 2:35)</i></p>
		  	<p>Here’s a situation where God needed to raise a priest who will be faithful to him. At that juncture, everyone expected God to choose someone who had prospects at least or was in the training for it.</p>
		  	<p>Amazingly, God chose someone who did not even know Him yet. When God began to call Samuel, the bible records: <i><b> “Now Samuel did not yet know the Lord,</b> neither was the word of the Lord yet revealed unto him.” (1 Samuel 3:7).</i> God indeed chose the least, and made the most out of him.</p>
		  	<p>The worst mistake you could ever make in Life is tagging God with a means of coming to your need—you’d surely miss out. When you pray, for a spouse, a job, finances, or anything else, be sure to pray with an open mind. God could meet all these needs with your least expectation. Be blessed!</p>
