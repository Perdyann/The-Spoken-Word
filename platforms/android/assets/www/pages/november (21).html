		  	<p><i>See then that ye walk circumspectly, not as fools, but as wise, Redeeming the time, because the days are evil. (Ephesians 5:15-16)</i></p>
		

		  	<blockquote>For every twenty-four hours given in a day, there should be an account of a divine impact made. </blockquote>

		  	<p>Time is the one of the tools of purpose, which God gave to man. It is like a staff; if it is not used for purpose, it kills! For every twenty-four hours given in a day, there should be an account of a divine impact made.</p>
		  	<p>Time is too precious to let go, such a great treasure to waste. You will never have the same day and time again. 10pm of January, 1st 2013 can never come back again because it is gone.</p>
		  	<p>Never let a second go without being utilized; not everything deserves your time and attention. For every day of your life, there should be an account of how the time was spent.</p>
		  	<p>God never gives an assignment without a time affixed; fulfillment is not all about getting the assignment accomplished someday, but getting it done within the time limit.</p>
		  	<p>At this season of your life, there is something God expects you to do. Are you living up to expectation? Don’t waste time living in ignorance; redeem every second!</p>
		  	<p>Only a fool lives without the consciousness of time; only a fool wastes valuable time; only a fool fails to redeem the time. The scripture admonishes us not to live as fools, but as wise.</p>
		  	<p>There is wisdom in redeeming the time; there is wisdom in taking advantage of every spare time. A wise man is never idle!</p>
		  	<p>So often, I’ve asked people, “how was your day?” and they responded, “It was boring . . . I was just sleeping and watching movies throughout.” That’s not wisdom. How can a man be burning with the Holy Ghost, and still be bored?</p>
		  	<p>We all have a Divine purpose for which we have been created; we all have mandates and assignments affixed to our purpose. Without a proper utilization of every second, we can never fulfill God’s given purpose for our lives. A life without purpose is vain; therefore, failure to redeem the time defines mere existence and not life.</p>
		  	<p>You might not have enough time for every other activity, but ensure you have time for God. Until you learn to prioritize God above every other affair, your life is yet to begin.</p>
		  	<p>It is not only Pastors, who are expected to spend quality time in the presence of God; it is not only Ministers, who have a Divine purpose.</p>
		  	<p>Your primary assignment is not Politics, even though that is good; your primary assignment is not lecturing, even though that is good; your primary assignment is not banking, even though that is good. No matter how lucrative it is, your career is not your primary assignment!</p>
		  	<p>The primary call and assignment of every man is the work of Ministry. Do not get too busy to invest in your primary assignment; no second is worth wasting, redeem the time. Be blessed!</p>
