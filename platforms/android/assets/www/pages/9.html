		  <div class="panel-body" style="text-align:justify">

		  	<p><i>“... for the joy of the Lord is your strength.” (Nehemiah 8:10b)</i></p>


		  	<blockquote>The strength of a man is located in his joy;. if the enemy can tamper with our joy, he’s gone a mile to paralyze our strength.</blockquote>

		  	<p>The joy of the Lord is our strength! I have experienced situations in life, which attempted to weigh me down; I have done terrible things which I eventually began to regret, and on several occasions, the conditions of some things tried to get me depressed. Even so, I held on, and wouldn’t let go of my joy, for the reason of one mystery that I was able to grasp.</p>
		  	<p>The strength of a man is located in his joy. Since the Joy of the Lord is our strength, we can conclude that if the enemy can tamper with our joy, he’s gone a mile to paralyze our strength. The enemy may have stolen everything from you, but never let go of your joy, for therein lies your strength. The bible says,</p>
		  	<p><i>Therefore with joy shall ye draw water out of the wells of salvation. (Isaiah 12:3)</i></p>
		  	<p>This passage, in simple terms portrays the fact that the benefits of salvation can only be gained and derived through joy. In essence, as long as you refuse to be joyous, you are denying yourself benefits that are genuinely yours’.</p>
		  	<p>Beloved, never let anything steal your joy, for your strength is hid in your joy. Even when a man falters, he can still be strong if he decides to be joyous. The bible declares,</p>
		  	<p><i>And he said unto me, My grace is sufficient for thee: for my strength is made perfect in weakness. (2 Corinthians 12:9)</i></p>
		  	<p>The strength of the Lord is made perfect in our weakness! You don’t need to be depressed. The enemy is happy when we experience weakness, falter and fall. Be sure not to keep the enemy happy for too long; don’t remain where you fell for another second. Always give room for the strength of the Lord to be made perfect in our weakness. Refuse to get depressed. Refuse to let go of your joy.</p>
		  	<p>It’s not that easy most times, but you’ve got to make it a choice. Ever wondered why the bible didn’t make use of the term ‘happiness’ but ‘joy’?</p>
		  	<p>Happiness is so different from joy. Happiness is conditional, if things happen to be going our way, we get happy, but when everything turns against us, we no longer seem to be happy.</p>
		  	<p>Unlike happiness, joy is unconditional; it is something that is constantly felt in God. It elevates you to a realm where you no longer care about what’s happening in your immediate environment. Indeed, that’s our strength, and it’s a decision.</p>
		  	<p>Beloved, we need to touch that depth of joy where nothing else bothers us. Don’t let go of your joy simply because you lost that job. By being joyous, you could be strong enough to get something better.</p>
		  	<p>The best days of my life are the days I deliberately decided to remain joyous. The only way the enemy dares to attack the strength of a man is to steal his joy, because he has also discovered that your joy is a carrier of your strength. Like never before, be joyous!</p>
