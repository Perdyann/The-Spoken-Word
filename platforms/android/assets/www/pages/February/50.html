		  	<p><i>Ye are the salt of the earth: but if the salt have lost his savour, wherewith shall it be salted? it is thenceforth good for nothing, but to be cast out, and to be trodden under foot of men. (Matthew 5:13)</i></p>
		  


		  	<blockquote>When you get polluted and misplace your worth, you become old-fashioned and despised.</blockquote>

		  	<p>The sole purpose of salt is to give savour... It is this characteristic of salt that makes it worthwhile. However, when salt loses it’s real potent, value and worth, it becomes utterly degraded, and useless.</p>
		  	<p>As a man, the thing that makes you valued, and desired above all else is your savour. In the heart of all men are hidden great potentials, treasures and talents. However, many have lost their innate deposits due to maltreatment, and as a result are being degraded and under-valued.</p>
		  	<p>These potentials embedded in you, is what exalts, announces and approves you above all else. When you get polluted and misplace your worth, you become old-fashioned and despised.</p>
		  	<p>David may have been the smallest of his brothers, but there was a savour inside of him, which approved him for the position of Kingship against all odds. Joseph may have been the youngest of his siblings, but there was a preserved savour inside of him that set him apart for greatness.</p>
		  	<p>There were times when Joseph could have resorted to polluting his savour, but he stood firm in God. When Potiphar’s wife tried to limit him by her act of seduction, he preserved his worth and fled.</p>
		  	<p>Every man has got an innate deposit. We only value some above others, because some have diligently preserved their savour, whereas others have resorted to polluting theirs.</p>
		  	<p>The bible makes us to understand that in the eyes of God, although sparrows are of great value, we are worth more than them all (Matthew 10:29-31)</p>
		  	<p>Do you really know your worth? I don’t think Samson knew his as much as Joseph did. That’s probably why Joseph could resist Potiphar’s wife, but Samson could not resist the touch of Delilah.</p>
		  	<p>I strongly doubt if Esau knew his worth so much . . . He easily gave in to trading his birth right for a temporal and momentary satisfaction.</p>
		  	<p>If you are a person of savour, you will not go round prostituting, compromising your stands, and selling your rights. These things depreciate your value and worth.</p>
		  	<p>Preserve your worth! There are many people with specific mandates, who will stop at no length to steal your savour. Like Joseph did, flee from such people</p>
		  	<p>Your birth-right is worth more than a pot of porridge... Your greatness is worth more than the touch of Potiphar’s wife... Your strength is worth more than the thighs of Delilah.</p>
		  	<p>Know your worth, and preserve it! Be blessed!</p>
