		  	<p><i>Then he said to him, Come home with me and eat bread. He said, I may not return with you or go in with you, neither will I eat bread or drink water with you in this place. For I was told by the word of the Lord, You shall not eat bread or drink water there or return by the way that you came.</i></p>
		  	<p><i>He answered, I am a prophet also, as you are. And an angel spoke to me by the word of the Lord, saying, Bring him back with you to your house, that he may eat bread and drink water. But he lied to him.</i></p>
		  	<p><i>So the man from Judah went back with him and ate and drank water in his house. (1 Kings 13:15-19)</i></p>
		  	


		  	<blockquote>The fall of many great men emanate from disobedience and negligence of God’s instructions.</blockquote>

		  	<p>Like never before, I admonish you; let nothing drift your focus from the Word of the Lord... Everything I have ever seen in life can be counterfeited, but the Word of God.</p>
		  	<p>Never rely on anything outside the Word of God, it is the only certainty we have; for even when heaven and earth passes away, the Word remains. (Matthew 24:35). I have heard of revelations through dreams, and I have heard the Words of several Prophets . . . On many occasions, all these were counterfeited, but I am yet to see the Word of God return void.</p>
		  	<p>Here is a young and promising Prophet, to whom the Lord spoke an instructive Word. If there’s one thing that was expected of him in that season, it was to stick to the Word. He tried, at least, he resisted the first temptation, but trying wasn’t good enough. He needed to hold on. An older, renowned, and more experienced Prophet lied to him!</p>
		  	<p>Have you ever been through that situation in life where God gives you a Word, and your mentor or God-father says something different?</p>
		  	<p>It is a different case when you’re unsure that it was God who spoke to you; it is a different situation when you are unable to discern. Yet, in a case where you are totally convinced that the Lord gave you an instruction, and a more experienced Man of God contradicts it, to whom should you hearken?</p>
		  	<p>Beloved, like nothing else, stick to the Word. Some people actually mean the best for you, but because they can’t see the vision God has given you alone, they may give you wrong advice.</p>
		  	<p>Some men of God who even have up to twenty years experience in Ministry may advise you and prophesy to you based on their previous circumstances, but be sure to stick to what God has told you. Men could fail! In fact, this particular scripture makes me to believe that experienced prophets could also lie; but remember—the Word of the Lord never fails.</p>
		  	<p>It is perplexing to fathom the fact that after the young prophet had neglected the Word of God, and embraced the lies of the Old Prophet; the Word of God came through the same Old Prophet. This goes a long way to prove that even though the Old Prophet may have lied, he still remains a Prophet of the Lord; at least God could still speak through him. (1 Kings 13:20-22)</p>
		  	<p>Grasp the fact that the gift of God is without repentance. The flaw of a Man of God doesn’t stop him from functioning in his office.</p>
		  	<p>Deliberately decide to stick to the Word of God. Never act on anything else, but the Word. Get rid of anything that could lead you to disobey and neglect God’s instruction.</p>
		  	<p>If there’s one thing I’ve learnt from experiences in the Word, it is—“the fall of many great men emanate from disobedience and negligence of God’s instructions.” As you meditate carefully on these words today, be deeply enriched!</p>
