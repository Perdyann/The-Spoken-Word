		  	<p><i>Then Daniel answered and said before the king, Let thy gifts be to thyself, and give thy rewards to another; yet I will read the writing unto the king, and make known to him the interpretation. (Daniel 5:17)</i></p>
		 

		  	<blockquote>When your focus drifts from purpose itself, to the resources involved, you are bound to derail. Purpose is priceless! </blockquote>

		  	<p>Daniel was a great man, popularly known for his ability to interpret dreams, dissolve doubts, and resolve hard sentences, in all knowledge and understanding. It was believed that he had an excellent spirit in him.</p>
		  	<p>He realized his gift and utilized it, he discovered his potentials and maximized them, he understood his purpose and assignment, and acted accordingly. There was hardly any moment of confusion, mostly regarding dreams, during which Daniel was not called.</p>
		  	<p>In this particular instance, the king did not just seek the efforts of Daniel to resolve his doubts, but promised to give reward in exchange for his service.</p>
		  	<p>It is important to note that before the king called Daniel, he had already summoned soothsayers and astrologers. These fellows were enticed by the reward the king offered; they had their focus on the price they were to receive. However, they could not accomplish the task, which the king set before them.</p>
		  	<p>Unlike these fellows, Daniel had no interest in the price; all he was after was fulfilling the purpose, for which he had been sent. By his response to the king, we can conclude that with or without reward, Daniel was set to fulfil his purpose.</p>
		  	<p>Here is the summary of it all â€” purpose is priceless! There is no amount of treasure too much or too little to accomplish any divine purpose. The fulfillment of purpose is independent of resources.</p>
		  	<p>Resources are good, and we use them for virtually every project; however, when your focus drifts from purpose itself, to the resources involved, you are bound to derail.</p>
		  	<p>If Daniel could effectively and efficiently dissolve the doubts of the king, without having an interest in the reward; then we also can accomplish any God-given idea or mandate, irrespective of the price, resources or reward.</p>
		  	<p>Stop prioritizing the reward over the task; purpose is priceless. Be blessed!</p>
