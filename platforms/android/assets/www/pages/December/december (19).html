		  	<p><i>And whatever you ask in prayer, you will receive, if you have faith.” (Matthew 21:22 ESV)</i></p>
		  	
		  	<blockquote>No amount of fasting will grant you that, which faith has not released. </blockquote>

		  	<p>Over recent years, many doctrines and myths about fasting have been imbibed; people are left believing that God responds to their needs based on the extent and length of their fast.</p>
		  	<p>Thus, they embrace the saying, “the more you fast, the more you receive.” Without a sound knowledge of the Word of God, it is easy to accept this as the truth, whereas, it’s real origin is from the pit of hell.</p>
		  	<p>Since the New covenant, God has never demanded that any man should fast before the receipt of anything can be made feasible.</p>
		  	<p>Notice, this scripture states that whatever we ask in prayer will be received, provided we have faith. It never states, ‘provided we fast for long’. Fasting is good exercise, but not a guarantee of receiving anything. In essence, if you have faith (whether you fast or not), you will receive all that you ask in prayer.</p>
		  	<p>I will never condemn fasting, because even Jesus fasted. However, I must address the misconception of the purpose of fasting. The purpose of fasting is not receiving. Jesus never fasted in order to receive anything!</p>
		  	<p>By his stripes, we were healed; we have been redeemed from the curse of law; we have overcome; we have been blessed with all spiritual blessings. All these are excerpts from different scriptures of the New Testament.</p>
		  	<p>The amazing thing about these scriptures is the use of past tense. We are not yet to be blessed, healed or made victorious. We have already been healed and blessed in all spiritual blessings. Why should you fast to receive that, which is already yours?</p>
		  	<p>Blessings, health and victories are freely given to us, by the virtue of the sacrifice Jesus made on the cross. The key to accessing these virtues is not fasting, but faith through knowledge from God’s Word.</p>
		  	<p>The only means to receive that, which God has freely given to us, is faith. No amount of fasting will grant you that, which faith has not released.</p>
		  	<p>Until I discovered the truth in God’s Word, I kept on fasting ignorantly, in order to receive from God. Before I sat for any examination, I always fasted for success; when anyone was sick, I fasted for healing; this routine of fasting to receive continued until I realized that success, health and prosperity are my birthrights, and I don’t need to fast to operate in them.</p>
		  	<p>God will not grant you success on any mission, because you fasted days and nights. Fasting does not increase your financial status, neither does it guarantee healing. Faith does! Don’t fast for something, which you have no faith about.</p>
		  	<p>Beloved, fasting is part of our lifestyle and nature; it is a spiritual exercise and discipline. There is nothing wrong in devoting days to fast, pray, and meditate on God’s Word; but fasting becomes wrong when it is done with the intention, motive and purpose of receiving from God.</p>
		  	<p>God regards your faith much more than He regards the length of your fast. This scripture clearly portrays the key to receiving anything, as asking in faith. That’s all you need to do!</p>
		  	<p>Stop fasting with wrong motives; increase your faith, by Knowledge from God’s Word. Allow your faith to transform infeasible circumstances to possible ones. Be blessed!</p>
