		  	<p><i>So I spoke to the bones for the Lord, as he said. I was still speaking, when I heard the loud noise. The bones began to rattle, and bone joined together with bone! (Ezekiel 37:7 ERV)</i></p>
		  	

		  	<blockquote>Speak the Word of God, even when it doesn’t seem like it. </blockquote>

		  	<p>If there’s one thing I’ve tagged the Word of God for, it is speed. The Word of God is quick and instant.</p>
		  	<p>When God took Ezekiel to the valley of dry bones, and commanded Him to prophesy to the dead bones, he obeyed. Notice one thing—while He yet spoke, the bones began to respond. The Word of God is so quick, that Ezekiel did not need to complete his statement, before he saw the results.</p>
		  	<p>Ezekiel was still speaking when he heard loud noise; he had not concluded his speech, before the result was manifest. That’s how quick the Word of God is. So many things happen when we speak the Word of God!</p>
		  	<p>When I studied this scripture, the prophecy of Isaiah was drawn to my memory. He said,</p>
		  	<p><i>And it shall come to pass, that before they call, I will answer; and while they are yet speaking, I will hear. (Isaiah 65:24)</i></p>
		  	<p>While we are yet speaking, He hears. While Ezekiel was still speaking, he began to see the results. Can you beat that? That’s how quick and effective God’s Word is.</p>
		  	<p>If you ever find yourself in an unpleasant situation, you know what to speak. God’s Word! Here’s an assurance that even before your speech is complete, you will receive your miracle.</p>
		  	<p>The reason why a lot of people are still caught up in ill situations is because they don’t even know anything about God’s Word, thus, they can’t speak it. When they see darkness, they speak darkness; when they see sickness, they speak sickness. Their words are propelled by their optical sight, and the worldly system, not God’s Word.</p>
		  	<p>We should learn to speak more of God’s Word. Even when it is visibly dark, speak light. Speak the Word of God, even when it doesn’t seem like it.</p>
		  	<p>Here’s another instance of how quick God’s Word is—the creation! It is written:</p>
		  	<p><i>Then God said, “Let there be light!” And light began to shine. (Genesis 1:3 ERV)</i></p>
		  	<p>Immediately God spoke light, it began to shine. The scripture did not say that God spoke light, and hours later, there was light. No! He only spoke, and instantly it was so.</p>
		  	<p>Jesus simply spoke the Word to the sick and infirmed, and instantly they received healing. Let’s analyze that for a second: if those fellows were to have a surgery in the hospital, how long would it have taken them to recover? Yet, Jesus spoke and the crippled walked instantly, the blind saw immediately and the deaf heard that same minute.</p>
		  	<p>What does that reveal to you? Verily, God’s Word is fast, swift and quick. Even the most difficult situation hears the Word of God and responds instantly. There is no better Word to speak than God’s Word.</p>
		  	<p>I decree that from this moment, while you are still speaking God’s Word, the results will be manifest. Because you have decided to speak God’s Word constantly, your miracles will not be postponed till another season. Amen. Be blessed!</p>
