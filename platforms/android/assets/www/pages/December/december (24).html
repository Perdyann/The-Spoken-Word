		  	<p><i>You say to your friend, ‘Let me get that little piece of dust out of your eye.’ Why do you say this? Can’t you see that big piece of wood in your own eye? You are a hypocrite. First, take the wood out of your own eye. Then you will see clearly to get the dust out of your friend’s eye. (Luke 6:42)</i></p>
		 

		  	<blockquote>When we keep capitalizing on the flaws of others, we are blinded to see our own bigger flaws.</blockquote>

		  	<p>The issue with quite a lot of people is that they tend to capitalize on the flaws of others, when they have not yet dealt with their own flaws, which in most cases is even worse than that of their neighbors.</p>
		  	<p>Some years ago, I was in a sermon; the topic spoken about that day was really convicting. It condemned some certain attitudes put on by Christians. Funny enough, I was listening to the sermon and wishing a certain friend of mine was there to hear it, because I felt she needed the conviction much more than I did.</p>
		  	<p>I am certain that if she was right there beside me, I would have turned to her and said, “Take note!” what I failed to realize is that I was trying to get her edified by the sermon without being edified myself. The sermon was meant for me and not her.</p>
		  	<p>God will not speak to you about the weaknesses of your brethren, when yours’ has not been dealt with yet. In that sermon, God was actually speaking to me and not her.</p>
		  	<p>I had so much judged her by that attitude, without realizing that I had a worse attitude. When we keep capitalizing on the flaws of others, we are blinded to see our own bigger flaws.</p>
		  	<p>Here’s another instance: Back in the days when I was yet in primary school; I sat in the examination hall with my classmates. The papers were distributed and everyone started writing except me. I was too busy looking out for those who will be involved in exam malpractice, so that I could quickly report them.</p>
		  	<p>Unknown to me, the clock was ticking faster than I thought. Before I knew it, the time was up; everyone had finished except me. I was too busy, looking for someone to judge, when I had not judged myself. This taught me a great lesson — when you pay too much attention to the flaws of people, you limit your own progress.</p>
		  	<p>Is it not crazy to comprehend that the person with wood in his own eyes, is the one who is so concerned about the dust in the eye of another brethren? This ought not to be so.</p>
		  	<p>Don’t be so quick to judge someone else, when you have not judged yourself. Tolerance is a great virtue; if you have not learnt to tolerate the flaws of others, you cannot improve yours’.</p>
		  	<p>Before you dare to blow the speck of dust out of the eye of your brethren, be sure to have removed the wood from your own eyes. Be blessed!</p>
