		  	<p><i>And he said unto them, Go ye into all the world, and preach the gospel to every creature. (Mark 16:15)</i></p>
		  	

		  	<blockquote>We were never commissioned to preach our opinions, but the gospel. </blockquote>

		  	<p>We have been commissioned to preach the gospel to every creature. However, over the years, people have drifted their focus from preaching the gospel of the Kingdom, to merely preaching their opinions.</p>
		  	<p>When I spared a moment to study about the life and message of Jesus, I realized that His major focus was on the Kingdom of God and heaven. Most of the parables He spoke of was likened to the Kingdom. About Jesus, it is written:</p>
		  	<p><i>From that time Jesus began to preach, and to say, Repent: for the kingdom of heaven is at hand. (Matthew 4:17)</i></p>
		  	<p>John the Baptist came with a major message of the Kingdom, about him is it said:</p>
		  	<p><i>In those days came John the Baptist, preaching in the wilderness of Judaea,</i></p>
		  	<p><i>And saying, Repent ye: for the kingdom of heaven is at hand. (Matthew 3:1-2)</i></p>
		  	<p>This particularly makes me to wonder—if Jesus and John the Baptist would not preach anything contrary to the gospel of the Kingdom, what justification do we have, to drift from preaching the gospel of the Kingdom, to preaching our own opinions?</p>
		  	<p>I have been in congregations, where the Word of God was supposed to be taught; I sat down all through the entire meeting, hoping to hear the gospel, but merely heard the preacher’s opinion on certain issues. Most times, this contradicted the gospel.</p>
		  	<p>There are messages that do more harm to the body of Christ, than they do edify. We were never commissioned to preach our opinions, but the gospel.</p>
		  	<p>Opinions are birthed from experiences, and everyone has got a different life experience. The gospel of the Kingdom is a gospel of healing, restoration, liberty and comfort.</p>
		  	<p>Sometimes people go through tests in life . . . as such; they may be held captive, and infirmed. This experience could limit a preacher from teaching the undiluted gospel of the Kingdom of God, to capitalizing on his own experience of captivity.</p>
		  	<p>Preaching the Gospel of the Kingdom somewhat entails telling a believer that he is above sickness, by virtue of his divine status. However, some preachers, who get sick often, are always too limited by their experience, that they avoid talking about Divine health.</p>
		  	<p>God is in need of vessels that will stand to preach the Word as it is; vessels that will refuse to be limited by their experiences and opinions.</p>
		  	<p>Beloved, be able to discern messages. It is good to be in the midst of counselors, but it matters a lot whose counsel you yield to. We should be able to differentiate between the gospel of the Kingdom and mere opinions.</p>
		  	<p>Relying on someone’s opinion is as bad as being guided by the experience of someone else. Someone once said, “Life is the most difficult exam, many fail trying to copy others not realizing that each one has a different question paper”</p>
		  	<p>Trying to apply the solution of someone else to your problems, may not necessarily solve it, the way it did solve his. But holding on to the gospel settles all issues. What is the gospel of the Kingdom?</p>
		  	<p><i>The Spirit of the Lord God is upon me; because the Lord hath anointed me to preach good tidings unto the meek; he hath sent me to bind up the brokenhearted, to proclaim liberty to the captives, and the opening of the prison to them that are bound;</i></p>
		  	<p><i>To proclaim the acceptable year of the Lord, and the day of vengeance of our God; to comfort all that mourn; (Isaiah 61:1-2)</i></p>
		  	<p>The gospel of the Kingdom is not a message of condemnation, but of restoration, salvation, good news, healing, liberty, and comfort.</p>
		  	<p>The Kingdom of heaven is the place where the Sons of God will spend eternity; the Kingdom of God is in our midst. It is a realm! A realm that places us above worldly rules and principles; until you step into that realm, life is yet to begin.</p>
		  	<p>Wherever the gospel of the Kingdom is preached, the glory of God is made manifest; lives are transformed, edified, saved and restored. If you want to operate in that realm of glory, stick to the gospel of the Kingdom. Listen to it; study it; meditate on it; preach it! Be blessed!</p>
