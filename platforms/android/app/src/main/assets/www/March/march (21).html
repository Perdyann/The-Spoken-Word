		  	<p><i>But all that heard him were amazed, and said; Is not this he that destroyed them which called on this name in Jerusalem, and came hither for that intent, that he might bring them bound unto the chief priests?</i></p>
		  	<p><i>But Saul increased the more in strength, and confounded the Jews which dwelt at Damascus, proving that this is very Christ. (Acts 9:21-22)</i></p>


		  	<blockquote>Until you intentionally decide to be strengthened and not broken by criticism, you may never live up to your call – 
			We are always greater than what men make of us.</blockquote>

		  	<p>People often say, “Your past will always haunt you,” I believe, that a man has the choice of either living in his past, or above it. You can choose to be tormented by your past; and you can choose to prove your past wrong by living above it.</p>
		  	<p>Saul made the latter choice. Even after God has arrested him, and filled with the Holy Spirit, people still spoke against him, and judged him based on who they knew him to be.</p>
		  	<p>Saul reacted to the criticisms of everyone in a matured way. He refused to be discouraged by the judgments of the crowd; rather, he was challenged to prove them wrong.</p>
		  	<p>He turned a deaf ear to all the names they called him. The more they criticized him, they more he was challenged to live above his past. Beloved, it says, <i> “But Saul increased the more in strength, and confounded the Jews which dwelt at Damascus...” (vs. 22)</i></p>
		  	<p>Saul, rather than being discouraged and broken by the judgment and criticism of everyone, was more strengthened, by the Power of God at work in him.</p>
		  	<p>Beloved, just like Saul, we may have been criticized in all ways, but here’s just one word for you—Until you intentionally decide to be strengthened and not broken by criticism, you may never live up to your call—We are always greater than what men make of us.</p>
		  	<p>In no time, Saul was stronger and more waxed in Spirit than all his critics. This is quite obvious in his statement, <i> “I thank my God, I speak with tongues more than ye all:” (1 Corinthians 14:18) </i></p>
		  	<p>Soon, his critics came to him for counsel, and he taught them the Word of God.</p>
		  	<p>Beloved, we have a lot of critics in our midst today. Rather than focusing on their own spiritual growth, they are more interested in tarnishing the image of others.</p>
		  	<p>In the process of criticizing Saul, their spiritual lives were getting drier, and they were derailing, whereas, Saul kept growing in strength, wisdom and knowledge of God. Quit criticism!</p>
		  	<p>The thing that critics fail to realize is that they are building up other people, at their own detriment. Furthermore, it is said:</p>
		  	<p><i>When Saul had come to Jerusalem, he tried to join the followers. But they were afraid of him. They did not believe he was a true follower of Jesus. (Acts 9:26)</i></p>
		  	<p>Beloved, just like Saul, people may not always believe in you initially, but they definitely can’t argue with your results. Just press on, your results will speak for you!</p>
		  	<p>Quit Criticism! Never assume that you know someone too well; God could cause a dynamic transformation in a very short period. Refuse to be criticized, neither be ye a critic. We have more valuable things to invest our time in, than criticism. Be blessed!</p>
