		  <div class="panel-body" style="text-align:justify">


		  	<p><i>Now the king was attracted to Esther more than to any of the other women, and she won his favor and approval more than any of the other virgins. So he set a royal crown on her head and made her queen instead of Vashti. (Esther 2:17)</i></p>

		  	<blockquote>Promotion does not go unaccompanied by its own trials.</blockquote>

		  	<p>Every promotion comes with a test that is only revealed in its season. Among all other women and virgins that were gathered and specially treated to please the King, Esther was set apart to be favored.</p>
		  	<p>What she didn’t know then was that every promotion carries a task.</p>
		  	<p>She was not favored because of her beauty alone. Her charisma and physical attributes didn’t attract the promotion as much as the Divine Mandate, and purpose for which she was pre-destined.</p>
		  	<p>It took a time of trial, for the genuine reason why she was chosen for the Kingdom, to be revealed. Through the mouth of Mordecai was it uttered, he said:</p>
		  	<p><i>For if thou altogether holdest thy peace at this time, then shall there enlargement and deliverance arise to the Jews from another place; but thou and thy father’s house shall be destroyed: and who knoweth whether thou art come to the kingdom for such a time as this? (Esther 4:14)</i></p>
		  	<p>Indeed, Esther was set apart for the kingdom, for such a time. The kingdom needed a vessel that will not blatantly ignore divine calls like Queen Vashti did. The Kingdom needed a vessel that will be willing to give up her life, and break protocols, despite the Kings threatening orders. The Kingdom needed a vessel of purpose!</p>
		  	<p>There is a reason why God puts us in certain positions at some seasons; we should always understand the purpose we are positioned to fulfil.</p>
		  	<p>Sometimes, we find ourselves in a position, which is tasking, demanding, and challenging; sometimes, we are not pleased with the position we occupy. Despite the challenge of our present position, we must learn to be purpose motivated.</p>
		  	<p>You are in the position you occupy for a purpose; the greatest mistake you can ever make is to step out of any position without a change or impact. Fulfilling purpose should be your goal in every season.</p>
		  	<p>Beloved, as much as we celebrate and relax when we get promoted, we must understand that every promotion has got a trying task. We should prepare for it!</p>
		  	<p>I’m pretty sure that during the promotion of Esther, she never imagined that there will ever come a time, when she will be required to put her life at risk for the Jewish people.</p>
		  	<p>We may have diligently served in our previous offices, but when we are promoted to a higher office, we must understand that the work involved will be more challenging than what we have previously faced.</p>
		  	<p>Beloved, much more than you celebrate any promotion, ordination or appointment, be sure to prepare for it. Indeed, promotion does not go unaccompanied by its own trials. Be blessed!</p>
