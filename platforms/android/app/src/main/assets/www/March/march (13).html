		  	<p><i>This book of the law shall not depart out of thy mouth; but thou shalt meditate therein day and night, that thou mayest observe to do according to all that is written therein: for then thou shalt make thy way prosperous, and then thou shalt have good success. (Joshua 1:8)</i></p>

		  	<blockquote>The constant meditation and declaration of the Word of God, is what guides and ushers a man into higher realms that men have never soared on before.</blockquote>

		  	<p>Over recent years, the world has been shaken by various circumstances that drained a few people of the very little, which they had. Many are left stranded, in a pressing situation.</p>
		  	<p>The economy has battled inflation, recession, deflation, amongst others. There has been a shift in the lives of many individuals. Thus, it is not quite predictable, what the nearest future may be like, if this persists.</p>
		  	<p>The dire need and desire of many men have become prosperity and good success. Men are not just satisfied with success, but good success; a type of prosperity that remains ever green, even when the economy lacks stability... a type of success that does not fade over time. Real prosperity!</p>
		  	<p>Only few get to realize that prosperity and good success is only found in God. I have seen many men that touched the peak of prosperity, and within a split second, it all faded. This has pushed them to a conclusion that wealth has got wings; they fly out just in the same manner as they flew in.</p>
		  	<p>Beloved, Jesus said something significant to the Samaritan woman: <i> “Jesus answered and said unto her, Whosoever drinketh of this water shall thirst again:</i></p>
		  	<p><i>But whosoever drinketh of the water that I shall give him shall never thirst; but the water that I shall give him shall be in him a well of water springing up into everlasting life.” (John 4:13-14)</i></p>
		  	<p>Verily, there is a kind of water that satisfies a man temporarily, but leaves him thirsty in no time; likewise, there is another kind of water (the living water) that permanently quenches all thirst and creates an innate fountain.</p>
		  	<p>Beloved, just like the comparison of normal water to living water, we also can compare earthly success with Divine prosperity. Earthly success satisfies a man temporarily, but leaves him stranded within a short period, while, Divine prosperity creates a fountain of success within a man, which eternally expels poverty from him.</p>
		  	<p>Well, based on our Word for today, the secret to Divine prosperity and good success emanates from constant meditation and declaration of the Word of God. This is what ushers a man into a realm of Divine success... a success that cannot be shaken by the height of economic crises.</p>
		  	<p>Notice, it is never said, “This book of law shall not depart out of thy eyes”, but mouth. In essence, we should not just see and read the bible like a novel, but we should constantly speak Rhema out of it.</p>
		  	<p>The constant meditation and declaration of the Word of God, is what guides and ushers a man into higher realms that men have never soared on before.</p>
		  	<p>Let the Words be in our mouth always! The secret and mysteries of real greatness on earth is declaring Rhema.</p>
		  	<p>Verily, there is no situation, for which Rhema is declared, that leaves you stranded or disappointed. When you need a job, appointment, or anything else, speak Rhema day and night. Declare it in the atmosphere at all seasons.</p>
		  	<p>Beloved, above all things always bear in mind that you can always speak yourself in and out of any situation. Declare it!</p>
