		  	<p><i>And Jesus came and said to them, “All authority in heaven and on earth has been given to me. Go therefore and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit, (Matthew 28:18-19 ESV)</i></p>
		  	

		  	<blockquote>That which the best surgeon cannot operate, the economy cannot guarantee, and our ability cannot produce, the name of Jesus performs. </blockquote>

		  	<p>Immediately after Jesus released His disciples to operate from the realm of all authority, he specifically commanded them to baptize their disciples in the name of the Father, Son and the Holy Spirit. This particularly makes me to understand that there is something about the name.</p>
		  	<p>How is it that Peter saw a lame man at the beautiful gate, and without praying for him, he simply commanded him to rise up and walk in the name of Jesus? (Acts 3:6) There must be something about that name — Healing!</p>
		  	<p>How is it that Paul saw a certain damsel (lady), with a strange spirit of divination, who followed them constantly, declaring that they are servants of God, and immediately, he cast out the Spirit in the name of Jesus, and the spirit came out? (Acts 16:16-18) There must be something about that name — Deliverance!</p>
		  	<p>How is it that in Acts 4:12 it is declared that there is no other name given, by which men should be saved, but the name Jesus? Again, in Joel 2:32, we are made to understand that anyone who calls on the name of the Lord shall be saved. There must be something about that name — Salvation!</p>
		  	<p>How is it that at the mention of the name Jesus, every knee should bow? There must be something about that name — Authority!</p>
		  	<p>Mark 16:17-18 proves that in His name shall we cast out demons, trample on serpents, drink poison and not be harmed. There is certainly something about the name, Jesus — Protection!</p>
		  	<p>John 14:13-14 proves that if we ask anything in His name, we shall receive. There must be something about that name — Provision!</p>
		  	<p>We cannot come to the Father except through Jesus, we cannot pray to the Father in any other name, but the name, Jesus. Beloved, the name Jesus is the signet and seal to our prayers.</p>
		  	<p>That which the best surgeon cannot operate, the economy cannot guarantee, and our ability cannot produce, the name of Jesus performs.</p>
		  	<p>Time and space will not be enough for me to prove all virtues embedded in the name, Jesus. It is a name that brings all elemental spirits of the world into subjection.</p>
		  	<p>The name of Jesus is our mantle of Authority. Jesus released us with as much authority as He has, and gave us the mantle, which is His name. It is our instrument of authority, use it in faith and produce exceptional results. Be blessed!</p>
