		  	<p><i>In the beginning [before all time] was the Word (Christ), and the Word was with God, and the Word was God Himself. He was present originally with God.</i></p>
		  	<p><i>All things were made and came into existence through Him; and without Him was not even one thing made that has come into being.</i></p>
		  	<p><i>In Him was Life, and the Life was the Light of men.</i></p>
		  	<p><i>And the Light shines on in the darkness, for the darkness has never overpowered it [put it out or absorbed it or appropriated it, and is unreceptive to it]. (John 1:1-5)</i></p>
		  	


		  	<blockquote>Understand that your purpose for being where you are is not to conform to any ill situation, but to transform it, by that Light, which you represent.</blockquote>

		  	<p>Everything we ever see on this surface only came into being because of the Word (Christ). As recorded in the passage above, without Him, existence wouldn’t be. There is not a single thing that came into existence of its own accord.</p>
		  	<p>Amazing to fathom, is the fact that the Life and Light of all men is in Him. Reading further, we get to understand that light has absolute supremacy over darkness. This is the exact reason why I keep saying, “At my presence, darkness is expelled”. It is spelt out clearly that darkness has never been able to overpower light. Ever wonder why past tense was used? Well, the Word of God does not pass away . . . that Word may even be for the end of the ages . . . In essence, darkness has never been, cannot, and will never be able to put out light.</p>
		  	<p>It is light that shines in darkness, and vanishes every atom of dimness. Light and darkness cannot have a dwelling together, there is no union whatsoever. One has to give way! In essence, wherever light enters, darkness has to be expelled. I have never been to a room that was initially filled with light, and eventually overshadowed by darkness. All I have experienced is a situation whereby a room is originally dark, and a torch, or lamp is brought in, and darkness gives way. You are the light of the world . . . the glory of God. Wherever you enter, darkness must vanish.</p>
		  	<p>Darkness is reflected in sickness, poverty, bondage, infirmity, captivity, amongst others . . . Wherever you go, all these must be expelled. I cannot share boundaries with sickness! Darkness can never put out light, therefore anyone we meet sick, should automatically be healed . . . captives are made free when they come in contact with us . . . the anointing to succeed is automatically transmitted to those we get in contact with. For indeed, we represent light, even in dark circumstances.</p>
		  	<p>As representatives of Light, what we should do is to shine, and stand out. You’ve got to be outstanding. Have this consciousness always! Don’t speak anyhow . . . don’t act carelessly . . . Let your life give light, hope, inspiration, and strength to those around you. Understand that your purpose for being where you are is not to conform to any ill situation, but to transform it, by that Light, which you represent. Amen!</p>
