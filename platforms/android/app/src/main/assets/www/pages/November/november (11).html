		  	<p><i>And take the helmet of salvation, and the sword of the Spirit, which is the word of God: (Ephesians 6:17)</i></p>
		  

		  	<blockquote>Salvation is the ground for living the Higher Life. Only salvation translates a man to the realm where God dwells. </blockquote>

		  	<p>Our focus today will be on the first aspect of this scripture — <i> And take the helmet of salvation.</i> </p>
		  	<p>The function of the helmet is to shield the head from injuries. So many cyclists would have died in fatal accidents, but for their helmets, the injury was minimal, and they survived.</p>
		  	<p>On the other hand, many cyclists actually died because their heads were crushed. It is believed that it might not have been the case if their heads were well protected with helmets.</p>
		  	<p>Salvation is likened to nothing else, but the helmet. In essence, just as the helmet prevents head injuries, salvation keeps the head free from harm.</p>
		  	<p>I believe and teach about the Higher Life always; God never created us to live a limited life—He made us in His own image. He made us to be above sickness, failure and poverty. He put eternity in our hearts, and power in our tongue; that’s why we say a thing, and it is established unto us.</p>
		  	<p>All the benefits of the God-life are only accessible by those who are saved; it is only through salvation that we can live above the principles of the world.</p>
		  	<p>All that I can ever teach about the Word of God, Revelation and His Spirit, will not really be practicable by someone who has not received salvation. Salvation is the ground for living the Higher Life.</p>
		  	<p>When you are not saved, there’s actually no power in your tongue; you’re not a partaker of God’s Divine nature yet, and you are still living at the mercy of the merciless devil. Only salvation translates a man to the realm where God dwells.</p>
		  	<p>Except a man is born again, he cannot see the Kingdom of God (John 3:3). A man can only be qualified to live the Kingdom life, when he has received salvation.</p>
		  	<p>Salvation is our helmet; when you go to battle without the helmet, you’d easily be defeated. An unsaved man cannot defeat or live above the enemy no matter how hard he tries, because as long as a man is unsaved, he is still a subject of the devil.</p>
		  	<p>Seeing then that our battle is not against flesh and blood, we ought to put on the helmet of salvation. Free yourself from head-injuries, by crowning yourself with the virtues of your new-birth. Be blessed!</p>
