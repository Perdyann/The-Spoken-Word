		  	<p><i>Now therefore go to, proclaim in the ears of the people, saying, Whosoever is fearful and afraid, let him return and depart early from mount Gilead. And there returned of the people twenty and two thousand; and there remained ten thousand. (Judges 7:3)</i></p>

		  	<blockquote>It takes men of readiness to speak calmness to the storms. Don’t be afraid of the storm; be ready to go  through it. </blockquote>

		  	<p>A man that constantly harbors fear in his mind, is not ready for any good thing; one of the things that give you an edge over any battle is your level of readiness.</p>
		  	<p>When it comes to victory in battles, I cannot but make reference to David; Goliath was a giant, greatly feared by everyone, but David. One thing that gave David an edge of Goliath was his readiness, which was portrayed by the nature of confessions he uttered before proceeding to fight.</p>
		  	<p>Spelling out his target of beheading Goliath and gaining victory, even before the battle began, clearly proves that he was not fearful but ready for victory.</p>
		  	<p>Beloved, are you fearful or are you ready? You cannot achieve the victory, which you’re not ready for; you cannot soar on a height that you are not ready to attain; you cannot accomplish the vision, which you are not ready to handle.</p>
		  	<p>Just like it was in the battle against the Midianites, the fearful were sent back, and the others remained. Notice that more people went back than those that remained. In essence, there were two times more fearful people than ready people.</p>
		  	<p>Generally, there are more fearful men than ready men; the truth, which many men fail to realize, is that fear is their greatest limitation. You cannot attain any height in life, when you constantly harbor fear in your mind.</p>
		  	<p>The entire thirty-two thousand men were all going for a battle, and more than half of them were harboring fear in their minds; they all wanted to be victorious, but were not ready to fight the battle for victory.</p>
		  	<p>Beloved, you cannot continue building with a team that is made up of fear and not readiness. Send the fearful people back. Whatever it is you want to achieve in life, be sure that it is motivated by readiness and not fear.</p>
		  	<p>When Jesus was in the boat with His disciples, the storms revealed the hearts of everyone therein. Jesus was ready to get to the other end of the sea, but the disciples were fearful. If it was only the disciples in that boat, it would have sunk.</p>
		  	<p>It is obvious that fearful things are bound to sink; fearful people are bound to be drowned; fearfully motivated projects cannot but fail. It takes men of readiness to speak calmness to the storms. Don’t be afraid of the storm; be ready to go through it.</p>
		  	<p>You might have prayed with several requests to God, but have you asked yourself if you are actually ready to receive them? What holds back the fulfilled requests from you is not God, but your level of readiness.</p>
		  	<p>Your level of readiness needs to be proven before you can receive. God is not willing to release to you something that you are not ready to receive.</p>
		  	<p>Are you fearful or are you ready? If you want victory, be ready for it; if you want greatness, be ready for it. Get ready!</p>>
