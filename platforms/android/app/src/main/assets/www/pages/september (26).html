		  	<p><i>Ah Lord GOD! behold, thou hast made the heaven and the earth by thy great power and stretched out arm, and there is nothing too hard for thee: (Jeremiah 32:17)</i></p>

		  	<blockquote>Stop having headache over issues that are not yours’ to worry about. Cast all your burdens upon Him, who is able to bear it up easily.</blockquote>

		  	<p>Nothing — not a single thing — is too difficult for thee O Lord. If He could create the heaven and the earth by His great power and outstretched arms, what is it that remains beyond his power?</p>
		  	<p>If nothing is too difficult for Him, then everything can be easily done by Him; your situation is not an exception from everything. Everything includes the height of problems that you’ve ever faced in life.</p>
		  	<p>I love to be specific: Cancer is not too difficult for Him to cure—He has done it before; AIDS is not too difficult for him to cure—He has done it before; your bills are not too much for Him to pay—He has caused even a fish to vomit money. I am yet to encounter a situation, which God considered too difficult to resolve.</p>
		  	<p>When all my strength is gone, when there is no power left in my body, when my arms are too frail and feeble to be stretched; I know that there is someone whose strength is inexhaustible. I know that there is someone, who considers nothing as being difficult enough.</p>
		  	<p>The songwriter was right when he stated, “O what needless pains we bear, all because we do not carry everything to God in prayer.” Verily, the reason why we were hurt isn’t because there is no solution, but because we tried to bear our burdens by our power.</p>
		  	<p>If you can carry every situation and task to God—whom nothing is too difficult for—then nothing will remain undone.</p>
		  	<p>You have forfeited peace long enough. It is needless that you bear that pain; only take it to the Lord in prayer. He has said that nothing is too difficult for Him, therefore, take all your burdens, weight and stress and lay it on the arms of the Father.</p>
		  	<p>Let you bills be more of His concern than yours; let your health be more of His concern than yours; let your success be more of His concern than yours. Stop having headache over issues that are not yours’ to worry about.</p>
		  	<p>Cast all your burdens upon Him, who is able to bear it up easily. Have this consciousness always: your situation might be beyond the ability of the Doctor, but it is not beyond the power of God.</p>
		  	<p>Why lean on the arm of flesh, which is bound to fail, when you can rest on the out-stretched arms of God, which guarantees success?</p>
		  	<p>If you have not spoken to God about a situation, don’t speak to anyone else about it. Take everything to the Lord in prayer today; nothing is too difficult for Him. Be blessed!</p>
