		  	<h5><strong>FAITH: Transcends Human Senses</strong></h5>

		  	<p><i>The other disciples therefore said unto him, We have seen the Lord. But he said unto them, Except I shall see in his hands the print of the nails, and put my finger into the print of the nails, and thrust my hand into his side, I will not believe. (John 20:25)</i></p>


		  	<blockquote>There is nothing that provokes the power of God, as much as faith</blockquote>

		  	<p>Despite every effort to convince Thomas that Jesus is risen, he still demanded to see, touch, and feel before he could ever believe. This is because Thomas is a man of his senses. Men of faith don’t need to see things before they believe... I am not surprised that the term doubting is always affixed to the name of Thomas.</p>
		  	<p>It is this same doubting-Thomas, of whom it is written that when Jesus had told the disciples that Lazarus was dead and He was going to wake him up, he said sarcastically, <i> “Let us also go, that we may die with him.” (John 11:16). </i> He relied more on nature and his human senses, than he did on faith, and that’s why, he could hardly receive anything.</p>
		  	<p>Beloved, don’t be men of your senses... Faith transcends human senses. If you must receive your miracle, then you must have faith, and kill your senses. Unlike Thomas, here’s the centurion servant, who relied more on faith than his senses.</p>
		  	<p><i>The centurion answered and said, Lord, I am not worthy that thou shouldest come under my roof: but speak the word only, and my servant shall be healed. (Matthew 8:8)</i></p>
		  	<p>The centurion didn’t need to see Jesus appear physically in his home, before he will be convinced that his servant is healed. He was a man of Faith, even Jesus attested thus: <i> “Verily I say unto you, I have not found so great faith, no, not in Israel.” (vs. 10) </i> There is nothing that provokes the power of God, as much as faith. Again it is written,</p>
		  	<p><i>For we walk by faith, not by sight (2 Corinthians 5:7)</i></p>
		  	<p>You don’t need to see, feel or touch, before you can activate faith. Faith works without sight. Never be moved by what you see... If at all you should move, let it be faith. Faith moves you to walk on water as though it were plain ground. The moment you begin to see the storms you would sink.</p>
		  	<p>It is faith that blinded the eyes of David, lest he was threatened by the giant size of Goliath. Indeed, if David was to spare a moment to compare Goliath’s size with his small physique, he never would have gained victory. A man of faith doesn’t walk by sight.</p>
		  	<p>Martin Luther King once said,—Faith is taking the first step even when you cannot see the entire staircase. Faith and sight can never be together... Faith is blind to natural circumstances. The moment you are able to see and consider situations around you, your faith gets weakened.</p>
		  	<p>Today, stir up your faith. Close your eyes, and mind to the threatening circumstances in your marriage, ministry, academics, business, amongst others, and give faith the opportunity to act it out. Be blessed!</p>
