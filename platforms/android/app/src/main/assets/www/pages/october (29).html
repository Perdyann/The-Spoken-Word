		  	<p><i>Above all things have intense and unfailing love for one another, for love covers a multitude of sins [forgives and disregards the offenses of others].</i></p>

		  	<blockquote>Love covers up evil, and reveals good; it conceals weaknesses and reveals strength. If you cannot cover up a multitude of sins, then you have not love.</blockquote>

		  	<p>There are seven things, which are hated by God and considered abominable in His sight, as stated in Proverbs 6:16-19. The seventh is he, who soweth discord amongst brethren.</p>
		  	<p>So often, many are swift to reveal the weaknesses and flaws of others; some will go to any length to create discord between brethren. This reveals the extent to which love is lacking in the hearts of many.</p>
		  	<p>The scripture today defines unfailing love, as one, which makes you willing to easily disregard the offenses of others. If you find it difficult to forgive, then your love is not intensified yet.</p>
		  	<p>Cain killed his brother out of jealously, simply because he did not offer a sacrifice, as acceptable as that of his brother, Abel. When asked by God, where his brother was, he blatantly admitted that he is not his brother’s keeper.</p>
		  	<p>If he loved Abel, as he loved himself, he would have been his brother’s keeper. If his love for Abel was intense and unfailing, he would never have conceived an evil thought against him.</p>
		  	<p>Intense love is quick to conceal the weaknesses of brethren. Revealing ones weakness to the world will do more harm than good; it is better off concealed and prayed for, than revealed for mockery.</p>
		  	<p>Some people are quick to create a wrong impression about others. Even if your neighbor has so many bad attitudes, it is not your responsibility to tarnish his image before everyone else.</p>
		  	<p>Unfailing love takes advantage of every opportunity to create good impressions.</p>
		  	<p>A man once asked his daughter, “how is your friend, Janet”, and to this, she replied, “that lazy girl? She should be fine ...”</p>
		  	<p>It is obvious by her response, that her love for her friend is not intense. She took advantage of the slightest opportunity to reveal the weakness of her friend, not minding whether that was the question she was asked or not.</p>
		  	<p>How intense and unfailing is our love for one another? How often do we take advantage of the slightest opportunity to destroy the name and reputation of our brethren?</p>
		  	<p>Love covers up evil, and reveals good; it conceals weaknesses and reveals strength. If you cannot cover up a multitude of sins, then you have not love; if you cannot disregard the offenses of others, then your love is not intense.</p>
		  	<p>Let love be genuine; take advantage of every opportunity to reveal the best in your neighbors. Unlike Cain, be your brother’s keeper. Be blessed!</p>
