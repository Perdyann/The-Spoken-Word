		  <div class="panel-body">

		  	<i style="text-align:justify">If the clouds are full of rain, they empty themselves upon the earth; (Ecclesiastes 11:3a)</i>
		  	<blockquote style="text-align:justify">The purpose of a scripture in your life is never complete until it relates personally to you, and your experiences.</blockquote>
		  	<p style="text-align:justify">The use of the term “if” portrays the fact that this statement is somewhat conditional. It is not until  the clouds get filled up that they can empty themselves upon the earth. The purpose of a scripture in your life is never complete until it relates personally to you, and your experiences.</p>
		  	<p style="text-align:justify">Likewise, the showers of blessings will never be poured in the life of an individual until valuable time has been set aside to fill up the clouds with rain . . . How do we actually get to fill up the clouds with rain? Confession! Incessant prayers! Devoted meditation on the Word of God!</p>
		  	<p style="text-align:justify">Whenever you make powerful confessions, declarations and Words of prayers, this goes up in the spirit realm and forms a cloud. The more of these words you speak, the fuller the clouds get, and gradually, they become pregnant with a solution, and an answer.</p>
		  	<p style="text-align:justify">This can be likened not only to confessions, but to deeds, as well as seed-sowing. Always be representatives of God in your actions . . . Act with love! These little actions may not seem significant initially, but very soon, as they compose a thick cloud of good deeds, the blessings will be showered. </p>
		  	<p style="text-align:justify">This scripture also gives the understanding that delay is sometimes caused by us, when we refuse to fill up our clouds with good tidings. People go months without studying the bible, some stay weeks without prayers, and at the end, they expect a miracle rain.</p>
		  	<p style="text-align:justify">How can you expect a heavy shower when your cloud stays for months before it could gather up a single drop of rain? Deliberately stand out, and release seeds to your clouds.</p>
		  	<p style="text-align:justify">As you walk in this year of revolution, determine to start each day with meditation, declare rhema, and pray in the Holy Ghost. Whatever it is that you intend to be, say it! Declare  it always, make a cloud out of your daily confessions, and await the latter rain. Amen!</p>
