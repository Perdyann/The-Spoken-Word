		  	<p><i>For the Father loveth the Son, and sheweth him all things that himself doeth: and he will shew him greater works than these, that ye may marvel. (John 5:20)</i></p>

		  	<blockquote>It is an error for us to be at the same pace with the world, when we can see what they cannot see.</blockquote>

		  	<p>For love, the Father reveals to the Son all things! The use of the term ‘all’ entails everything; in essence, nothing remains hidden.</p>
		  	<p>Again it is said that the Father will even reveal greater to the Son than He already has.</p>
		  	<p>It is not in the nature of the Father to reveal some things, and leave out missing information. If at all the Father reveals, then it is all things and not some.</p>
		  	<p>Reading this scripture, it might be easy to conclude that it only implies to Jesus, but with an intent meditation, our eyes are open to see that perhaps at that time, Jesus was the only Son of God, but by His death and resurrection, we have been made Sons.</p>
		  	<p>Our relationship with God now transcends that of a servant and his master; we are now Sons of God, like Jesus is to Him. Therefore, if the Father does nothing, without revealing it to His sons, it means that all things are revealed to us.</p>
		  	<p>Why then should we remain ordinary men, when God has revealed extra-ordinary things to us? Why then should we act ignorantly, when the Knowledge of greater things has been made available to us?</p>
		  	<p>I cannot but be successful because of the magnitude of what God has bestowed on me. It is an error for us to be at the same pace with the world, when we can see what they cannot see.</p>
		  	<p>However, no matter how much of a Christian you claim to be, you just can’t fathom greater truths when you don’t relate with the Lord as your Father. If you don’t have the time to commune with Him daily; if you can’t give audience to His Word; if you cannot spend quality time in His presence; then you sure cannot receive what He has in store for you.</p>
		  	<p>Just as it is said, the Father will reveal even greater; God wants to reveal to you much more than you already know. Don’t be satisfied with the extent of knowledge and revelation you have, for the Lord is inexhaustible.</p>
		  	<p>He can never run out of revelations; there is something greater than what you have, go for it.</p>
		  	<p>Even though God has revealed all things, we cannot know them, without abiding constantly in His Presence, giving Him our time and attention, and meditating intently on His Words.</p>
		  	<p>Don’t take an action without a revelation; find out what God has for you in this season, and align your actions to that will. Be blessed!</p>
