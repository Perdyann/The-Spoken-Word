		  	<p><i>And Joseph dreamed a dream, and he told it his brethren: and they hated him yet the more. (Genesis 37:5)</i></p>
		  

		  	<blockquote>Some people mean the best for you, but because they cannot see what you see, they will talk you out of purpose.</blockquote>

		  	<p>Ever wondered why Joseph was hated all the more, whenever he shared his dreams and visions? Ever wondered why Stephen was stoned to death when He saw the glory of God (Acts 7:55)? When people don’t see what you see, they will always hate and persecute you.</p>
		  	<p>Just because Joseph’s brothers couldn’t see what he saw, they plotted to nullify his dreams. Just because the persecutors of Stephen couldn’t see what he saw, they plotted to put an end to his life.</p>
		  	<p>I believe that if Joseph’s brothers could see what he saw, they wouldn’t hate him, but encourage him; I believe that if the persecutors of Stephen could see the glory he saw, they wouldn’t have stoned him to death.</p>
		  	<p>It is obvious that your haters are not against you, but your vision; only spiritually myopic people fight against divinely orchestrated visions.</p>
		  	<p>When people don’t see what you see, they will go an extra mile to fight against your vision. As long as Saul’s eyes were blinded by scales, he couldn’t see what the believers saw; thus, he went an extra mile to persecute them.</p>
		  	<p>When you are a man of vision, only mingle with people of vision. As long as the crowd cannot see what you see, they will always strive to abort your ideas and visions.</p>
		  	<p>When Mary was pregnant, she couldn’t seek companionship anywhere else, but in Elizabeth, a fellow pregnant woman. She didn’t just meet any pregnant woman on the street, but someone with her kind of pregnancy — someone pregnant with destiny.</p>
		  	<p>When Elizabeth heard the salutation of Mary, the baby in her womb leaped for joy. Only open your door to people with like passion, whose presence stir-up the vision of God within you.</p>
		  	<p>When Elizabeth spoke with Mary, something came alive within her; people with similar vision like yours’ will always give life, strength and support to your vision and seed, but people who don’t see what you see, will always strive to kill your seed, dreams and visions.</p>
		  	<p>Joseph eventually had to separate from his near sighted brothers, before he could fulfil his dreams; likewise, before you can attain the destiny you envisage, you must disassociate from fellows who cannot see what you see.</p>
		  	<p>Joseph’s Father was not like his brothers, he loved him genuinely. However, he rebuked him when he heard about his dream (Genesis 37:10). Actually, some people mean the best for you, but because they cannot see what you see, they will talk you out of purpose.</p>
		  	<p>Hence it’s important for you to be discerning enough to differentiate between advices birthed from hatred, near-sightedness, love or vision.</p>
		  	<p>Let your vision define your association; don’t force yourself to be connected to people, whom your vision has not attracted. Let your vision define your mentors and leaders; you cannot follow someone without a clear vision. Be blessed!</p>
