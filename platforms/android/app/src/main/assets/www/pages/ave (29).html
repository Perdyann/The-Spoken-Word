		  	<p><i>And the sun stood still, and the moon stayed, until the people had avenged themselves upon their enemies. Is not this written in the book of Jasher? So the sun stood still in the midst of heaven, and hasted not to go down about a whole day. (Joshua 10:13)</i></p>


		  	<blockquote>Nature might stand as a limit to a natural man, but definitely acts in favor of a supernatural being. </blockquote>

		  	<p>Many men have walked in different places and paces in the world; at a certain juncture, nature poses a limit to man. However, some defied the course of nature.</p>
		  	<p>In the time of Joshua, the course of nature was defied. The sun and moon have a set time to rise and set, however, for the sake of the Israelites, whom the Lord fought for; nature remained still, and watched the Israelites win the battle.</p>
		  	<p>Moses refused to be limited by the red sea. When they fled from the Egyptians, they encountered the red sea; they could have decided to give up at the sight of the red sea, but he called on God in faith and by the instruction of God, the red sea parted ways for them to go by, and swallowed the Egyptians after them. Nature acted in their favor!</p>
		  	<p>Likewise, When Elijah and Elisha encountered the red sea at certain instances, by striking it with a rod; nature received their signal, and paved a way for them. Mere men would have been limited by the natural sea, but these men defied the course of nature.</p>
		  	<p>Jesus came with a greater understanding of the higher realm, and He encountered the sea, but didn’t even consider it a limit to His motion. He didn’t need to embrace the principle of striking it with a rod; He walked majestically on it, without sinking. Nature had no choice, but to act in His favor.</p>
		  	<p>Beloved, when you got born-again, many things happened! You were translated from the earthly realm to the higher realm. From that moment, you ceased to be subject to nature.</p>
		  	<p>Nature might stand as a limit to a natural man, but definitely acts in favor of a supernatural being.</p>
		  	<p>We cannot be bound by the limits nature poses. The sun, moon, stars, mountains, and clouds are components of nature. These very components now act in our favor.</p>
		  	<p>Just like the rod-strike of Moses, Elijah and Elisha sent a signal to the sea to part; and just like the presence of the Israelites in the battle-field sent a signal to the sun and moon to be still; so shall our presence send a signal to all mountains before us to become a plain. We are above all these now; nature acts in our favor! Be blessed!</p>
