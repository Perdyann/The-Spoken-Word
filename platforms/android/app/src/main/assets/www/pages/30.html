		  	<p><i>And he said, The things which are impossible with men are possible with God. (Luke 18:27)</i></p>


		  	<blockquote>There is nothing that remains caught up in the chains of impossibility when you have gotten to the point of believing. Believing gradually releases and catapults you to the realm of all possibilities!</blockquote>

		  	<p>When we heard that all things are possible with God, we probably envisaged things like eating, drinking, walking, amongst other things which we’ve seen happen. This passage goes a bit further to state that even the things which men have written-off as impossible, are easily made possible by the grace of God.</p>
		  	<p>I have seen the lame walk... I have seen the blind see... I have seen the dead rise... I have seen a man walk on water (Jesus). But none of this happened outside the presence of God. The possibility of everything differs from one personality to another, depending on the realm in which they dwell. Habitants of the earthly realm are all bound by nature... they can’t see far. However, habitants of God’s realm of Life were born to break human protocols.</p>
		  	<p>The things which are termed ‘impossible’ in the earthly realm are part of the commonalities in God’s Realm of Life. When the ear of Malchus was cut off, the possibility of him hearing again was doubted by all men, but Jesus touched his ear and healed him. (Luke 22:50-51). Beloved, as long as the Father is concerned, all things are possible.</p>
		  	<p>All you need to do is to decide whose report to believe. When the Doctor says that you’ve got an incurable disease or a terminal ailment, always have it in mind that he is speaking on the basis of human knowledge, however, with God, all things, including the restoration of your health is possible.</p>
		  	<p><i>Jesus said unto him, If thou canst believe, all things are possible to him that believeth. (Mark 9:23).</i></p>
		  	<p>The passage above says that ALL things are possible. Ever wondered why it didn’t say ‘some things’? Because indeed, everything and anything is possible! There is nothing that remains caught up in the chains of impossibility when you have gotten to the point of believing... Believing gradually releases and catapults you to the realm of all possibilities!</p>
		  	<p>Just believe! Don’t panic over the Doctor’s report; God has a better report... Don’t fret over what the Doctors have said; God has said something better... even when the crowd makes you to doubt it, keep your focus on possibilities. Just believe!</p>
