		  	<p><i>Do not be so deceived and misled! Evil companionships (communion, associations) corrupt and deprave good manners and morals and character. (1 Corinthians 15:33 AMP)</i></p>

		  	<blockquote>Until a godly character is developed, you will compromise for just anything.</blockquote>

		  	<p>Character is what defines a man; when a man lacks good character, he is easily tossed to and fro by every wind. Likewise, when a man builds up an impeccable character, his standing is before kings and not mere men.</p>
		  	<p>Great men are men of character; a man without character is a disaster ready to occur. Many have struggled endlessly to attain a recognized position, achieve an ambition, and get on the seat of influence. What they often fail to realize is that no position can be sustained without character.</p>
		  	<p>You might actually achieve your desired position, but when that position is occupied by a man, that lacks viable character, more harm is recorded, than good.</p>
		  	<p>Many things could lead you to a recognized position in life, but only a developed character can sustain you there. Some achieved greatness at a young age, but crashed down in no time. Great men, who have stood the test of time, are those, who mounted greatness with a developed character.</p>
		  	<p>Rather than pursuing after ambitions, and seeking opportunities in every nook and cranny, invest quality time to developing your character. When character is built, great opportunities and positions seek you.	</p>
		  	<p>This scripture goes a long way to portray the relationship between character and companionship. It reveals that bad company ruins good character, and in the same sense, good company enhances good character.</p>
		  	<p>In order to develop a good character, you must be in good company. You must have a standard, and that standard should define your friends.</p>
		  	<p>Shedrach, Meshach and Abednego couldnâ€™t just bow to the idol, because they had succeeded in developing a godly character. Verily, until a godly character is developed, you will compromise for just anything.</p>
		  	<p>Daniel did not defile himself with the fats of the kings table for days, because he had developed his character. This character fetched him recognition, promotion and respect.</p>
		  	<p>These fellows mingled with each other; they were never caught in the companion of fools, neither did they find comfort seating in the seat of the scornful. When you invest hours chatting with fools, you become morally depraved in no time.</p>
		  	<p>A man of character does not follow the crowd; a man of character is outstanding; a man of character does not mingle anyhow; a man of character is a man with set principles and standards. You can never lure a man of character out of the boundaries of his set standards.</p>
		  	<p>More than you aspire to develop anything else, develop your character. Be blessed!</p>
