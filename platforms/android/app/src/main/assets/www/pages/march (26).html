		  <div class="panel-body" style="text-align:justify">


		  	<p><i>For whatsoever is born of God overcometh the world: and this is the victory that overcometh the world, even our faith.</i></p>
		  	<p><i>Who is he that overcometh the world, but he that believeth that Jesus is the Son of God? (1 John 5:4-5)</i></p>

		  	<blockquote>The height of error is reached, when a Christian is found struggling in the realm of fear, and not faith. </blockquote>

		  	<p>Being born of God automatically places us in a position to overcome, but it is only through faith that the victory is actually transferred to us. Faith is the victory that actually overcomes the world.</p>
		  	<p>Many Christians today are living like mere men. This ought not to be! By being born-again, we were translated from the realm of the ordinary to God’s realm of life. We ceased to be mere men, but spirits.</p>
		  	<p>From the moment we got born-again, natural rules and worldly principles ceased to have a grip over us. We became above everything! We became partakers of God’s Divine Nature. Sickness, failure and poverty became alienated words.</p>
		  	<p>It is in God’s nature to reign! If indeed we have the same nature with God, it is an error for us to be subjected to situations which we should freely reign over. We should always overcome.</p>
		  	<p>Why then do Christians, as though they were not born of God, still perish in ill situations?</p>
		  	<p>Jesus overcame the world, not just because He was born of God, but because He activated His birth-rights by faith. Likewise brethren, don’t stop at being born-again. You must activate your birth-right by faith, in order to overcome.</p>
		  	<p>Men who own the world, and reign in life, are men of Faith, who know their stand and identity in Christ. Until you swim in the realm of faith, you may never know what it means to overcome.</p>
		  	<p>Beloved, not many Prophets of old (in the era of the law) were given this grace to be Sons of God, and partakers of His Divine nature. Many longed to see, and have what we do, but could not.</p>
		  	<p>When you experience series of trials on a daily basis, do you fret and flee, as though you have no power over it? Or do you act faith and authority over it, to prove that you are born of God?</p>
		  	<p>Beloved, fear and doubt is the very opposite of faith. The height of error is reached, when a Christian is found struggling in the realm of fear, and not faith.</p>
		  	<p>Whatsoever mountains there are, laid before you today; fear not, act faith and overcome!</p>
		  	<p>Bear in mind always—Although overcoming is our birth-right, we may not be able to access it, until our faith is activated — Be blessed!</p>
