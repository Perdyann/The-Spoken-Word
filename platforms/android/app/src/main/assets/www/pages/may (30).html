		  	<p><i>And Peter answered him and said, Lord, if it be thou, bid me come unto thee on the water.</i></p>
		  	<p><i>And he said, Come. And when Peter was come down out of the ship, he walked on the water, to go to Jesus.</i></p>
		  	<p><i>But when he saw the wind boisterous, he was afraid; and beginning to sink, he cried, saying, Lord, save me. (Matthew 14:28-30)</i></p>

		  	<blockquote> “Keep the focus” As long as your focus is right, your destiny remains insured. Anything that steals your focus impairs your mobility. </blockquote>

		  	<p>The issue most Christians have is that they don’t understand their identity in Christ; as a result, they pay too much attention to insignificant things.</p>
		  	<p>When you understand the magnitude of what we have as Sons of God, then you will disparage challenges and trials. The truth is, as a Son of God, you can never be overcome by trials. The fact that the storms roar against you, doesn’t mean that they can get you drowned.</p>
		  	<p>Jesus told Peter to walk on the water with him. Notice that as long as Peter’s focus remained on God’s Word to him, he walked on the water, but the moment he drifted his focus to the storm and began to pay attention to its roar; he got distracted and began to sink.</p>
		  	<p>The more Peter paid attention to the storm, the more he magnified it above God’s Word in his spirit. Consequently, his faith got weakened, and he began to derail.</p>
		  	<p>Verily, anything you focus too much on gets magnified in your life. When your entire focus and sight is on God, He is magnified in your life, and you will only know progress. However, when you focus too much on the storms of life, you are indirectly magnifying it, and soon, it will drain you of all your strength.</p>
		  	<p>Those trials are not really as tough as you deem them. The challenges don’t deserve your attention. When you consider these to be important in your life, they gain an advantage over you.</p>
		  	<p>Isn’t it funny how we often spend more time thinking of how to sort out our problems, than we commune with God? When you give your problems more time than God, you’re indirectly magnifying them above God.</p>
		  	<p>A man, who knows his stand in God, eats up challenges like bread. God has said in His Word, <i> “Behold, I am the Lord, the God of all flesh: is there any thing too hard for me?” (Jeremiah 32:27)</i></p>
		  	<p>Verily, the height of your challenge is nothing compared to ability of God at work in you. As long as Peter had his focus on Jesus, and as long as he magnified His words, the sea was not capable of hindering his motion. Therefore, as long as you can magnify God in everything, you remain unstoppable; nothing can limit you!</p>
		  	<p>I always say to everyone, “Keep the focus” As long as your focus is right, your destiny remains insured. Anything that steals your focus impairs your mobility.</p>
		  	<p>Some people say, “This trial is so great. I’m in such a huge mess. I’m in big trouble ...” Why refer to your challenges as huge, great and big? The more you consider them great, the more your faith gets weakened, and you begin to drown.</p>
		  	<p>O yea, Peter only began to sink when he thought, “what a strong wind ...” As long as he magnified God, he was the boss of his challenges.</p>
		  	<p>When you magnify God’s promises in your life over your present problems, you will tread upon all trials and overcome. But the moment you begin to ponder too much on your problems, they get magnified, and drain out every bit of potential in you.</p>
		  	<p>Beloved God has said ‘come’; He has called you to the place of your destiny. Stay focused on His Word, and never pay attention to the storms you experience on the way.</p>
		  	<p>Beloved, choose ye this day whom to magnify. Will you, like Peter, get distracted by the petty trials in the world or will your focus remain on the Author and Finisher of your fate? Be blessed!</p>
