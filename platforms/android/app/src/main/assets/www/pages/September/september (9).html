		  	<p><i>For there is one God, and one mediator between God and men, the man Christ Jesus; (1 Timothy 2:5)</i></p>
		  	<p><i>And to Jesus the mediator of the new covenant, and to the blood of sprinkling, that speaketh better things than that of Abel. (Hebrews 12:24)</i></p>
		  

		  	<blockquote>Jesus is our mediator; what you could never achieve on your own can be easily accomplished when you go in the name of Jesus.</blockquote>

		  	<p>A mediator is an intercessor, who acts as a link between parties. Paul was a mediator between Philemon and his servant, Onesimus. It was through his negotiation, intervention and intercession that Onesimus was received by Philemon, to a higher place.</p>
		  	<p>Without a mediator, an agreement of being received to a higher place is infeasible to be reached.</p>
		  	<p>Jesus is the mediator between God and men; there is no other way to gain access to the Father, except through Jesus Christ. Without Him, it would never have been possible for us to be called Sons of God.</p>
		  	<p>He is the mediator of the new covenant; the new covenant spoken about in Jeremiah 31:31-34 can only be received through Jesus Christ.</p>
		  	<p>Before the time of Jesus, people made sacrifices for their sins through the blood of animals; but by the blood of Jesus, we have now received remission for our sins.</p>
		  	<p>We were captives, slaves and servants, but through Jesus we have received adoption as Sons. The position of Sonship could never be attained without the mediator, Jesus Christ.</p>
		  	<p>Onesimus knew that he couldn’t approach Philemon directly; he’d probably be rejected. For this reason, he came through a mediator, Paul, and he was accepted to a higher position.</p>
		  	<p>Beloved, in the same way, we could never be partakers of God’s Divine Nature, had it not been for the blood of Jesus.</p>
		  	<p>Jesus is our mediator; what you could never achieve on your own can be easily accomplished when you go in the name of Jesus. David could never defeat Goliath by his own ability and strength, but when he went in the name of Jesus, the mediator, the defeat of Goliath became history.</p>
		  	<p>It is written, <i> “ for by strength shall no man prevail.” (1 Samuel 2:9) </i> If the battles were to be fought by our strength, no man shall prevail; but rejoice brethren, we have a mediator.</p>
		  	<p>When we go through a mediator, we receive access to inaccessible realms, we gain victory over impossible situations, and we are placed in a higher position.</p>
		  	<p>Beloved, don’t confront that challenge with your physical strength and ability; go through the mediator, Jesus Christ. Be blessed!</p>
