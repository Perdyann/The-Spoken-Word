		  	<p><i>And she said unto him, How canst thou say, I love thee, when thine heart is not with me? thou hast mocked me these three times, and hast not told me wherein thy great strength lieth. (Judges 16:15)</i></p>


		  	<blockquote>It is a shame to have fallen many times, without learning how to stand. Never pass through any phase in life, without a lesson to show  for it.</blockquote>

		  	<p>It is often said, “To make a mistake is never a mistake, but to repeat it, is a big mistake.” Verily, making a mistake once is not an issue; we’ve all made mistakes at some point; but repeating a mistake over and over again is intolerably erroneous.</p>
		  	<p>I have fallen several times, but one thing I did constantly was to rise up greater, and take more precautions. That is quite unlike Samson.</p>
		  	<p>When I read through the story of Samson and Delilah, the most persisting thought that went through my mind was that of how Samson was unwilling to learn, even after the reoccurrence of several instances.</p>
		  	<p>Delilah clearly stated that Samson had mocked her three times; I believe three times is enough for Samson to have learnt that Delilah meant more harm than good.</p>
		  	<p>On three occasions, after he had falsely mentioned the source of his strength to her, she attempted to use it against him. She called his enemies to capture him by all means. After a failed attempt to overpower him on those three occasions, she persisted all the more to discover the true source of his strength.</p>
		  	<p>Perhaps, the first time Samson revealed his strength to Delilah, it was a slip of tongue; the second time, it was a mistake; the third it was a flaw. But I am convinced that it’s reoccurrence for the fourth time is a choice.</p>
		  	<p>Revealing his secret over and over again to someone, who was obviously on a mission to destroy him ceased to be a mistake, but a choice he made to be destroyed.</p>
		  	<p>With all that had happened, the least I expected of Samson was the realization of the fact that Delilah was on a mission to destroy him. However, being so blinded and lured by his desires, he couldn’t perceive anything.</p>
		  	<p>Isn’t it crazy sometimes, that although the handwritings are boldly inscribed on the walls, we still can’t read them clearly, because we are blinded by certain factors?</p>
		  	<p>The experiences you have been through lately are enough to pass on a message to you. Refuse to be too blinded and carried away to realize that.</p>
		  	<p>You narrowly resisted temptation the first time, yet you intentionally went to dwell in the place of your temptation over and over again. Beloved, it is no longer a mistake, but a choice.</p>
		  	<p>A word is enough for the wise! Everything that has happened in your life lately is enough to teach you something. It is shame to have lived many years, without learning anything.</p>
		  	<p>It is a shame to have fallen many times, without learning how to stand. Never pass through any phase in life, without a lesson to show for it. Be blessed!</p>
