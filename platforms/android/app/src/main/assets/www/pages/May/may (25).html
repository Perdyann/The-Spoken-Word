		  	<p><i>But I fear, lest by any means, as the serpent beguiled Eve through his subtilty, so your minds should be corrupted from the simplicity that is in Christ. (2 Corinthians 11:3)</i></p>


		  	<blockquote>Even if you lose anything else in life, never lose consciousness of your identity in Christ. Knowing your stand in God is what gives you victory in all spheres.</blockquote>

		  	<p>There is an issue that is so strong on my mind to address. Many Christians make the mistake of thinking that the enemy has got the power to act against them. It takes understanding of the Word of God, to realise that the devil is powerless. He does not have the ability to do anything at all!</p>
		  	<p>Do you really think the enemy drove Adam and Eve out of the Garden of Eden? No way! He does not have that power. The only thing the enemy has is the weapon of deceit. All he did to Adam and Eve was to deceive them.</p>
		  	<p>The enemy has no power, but deceit</p>
		  	<p>He can only deceive you into believing that you are a slave, when really you are a King.</p>
		  	<p>He can only deceive you into thinking that you are his servant, when really you are in charge.</p>
		  	<p>He can only deceive you into thinking that you are a debtor, when really you are a creditor.</p>
		  	<p>However, his weapon of deceit can only capture one, who is ignorant. When you fully understand your Identity in Christ, there is nothing the enemy can do to deceive you.</p>
		  	<p>Sometimes, when we go through trials, the enemy might begin to speak saying, “Are you sure you can recover from this?” Beloved, in ignorance, you might give up, but when you are knowledgeable of God’s Word, you will understand that whatsoever is born of God overcomes.</p>
		  	<p>You can never be sick, you can never be defeated, and you can never be disappointed in life. Don’t be deceived into thinking that you are anything below your Divine Status.</p>
		  	<p>The knowledge and understanding of God’s Word, makes the weapon of the enemy ineffective. The serpent (enemy) told Eve that if they eat the fruit, they will be like gods (Genesis 3). If only she had enough understanding to know that they were already like God, she wouldn’t have fallen.</p>
		  	<p>Verily, God created all animals normally, but created man in His likeness. Therefore, Eve and Adam were already like God, but never knew. Their only mistake was ignorance.</p>
		  	<p>Beloved, the only advantage the enemy can have over a Christian is ignorance. If you know who you are, his weapon of deceit can never harm you.</p>
		  	<p>The devil tried to lure Jesus to bow before him, saying, <i> “All these things will I give thee, if thou wilt fall down and worship me” (Matthew 4:9). </i> Verily, the things which the enemy promised to give Jesus if He bows, were Jesus heritage as the Son of God. The earth is the Lords and its fullness thereof (Psalms 24). Even the earth which the enemy offered Jesus was not his own.</p>
		  	<p>If Christ was not aware of His heritage and if He did not know and understand His identity, He might have ignorantly been captured by the deceit of the enemy.</p>
		  	<p>Isn’t it sad how many have sold their souls to the enemy, in order to obtain things which are their own heritage as Sons of God? As Sons of God, if you don’t know who you are, you may lose your possession to the enemy.</p>
		  	<p>Even if you lose anything else in life, never lose consciousness of your identity in Christ. Knowing your stand in God is what gives you victory in all spheres.</p>
		  	<p>The enemy might be deceitful; but we remain conscious of our identity in Christ, indeed, we can never be defeated. Be blessed!</p>
