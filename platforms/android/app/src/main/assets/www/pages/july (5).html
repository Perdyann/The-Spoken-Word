		  	<p><i>In the morning David wrote a letter to Joab and sent it with Uriah. In it he wrote, “Put Uriah out in front where the fighting is fiercest. Then withdraw from him so he will be struck down and die.” (2 Samuel 11:14 NIV)</i></p>
		  	
		  	<blockquote>Always be mindful of the extent you go to cover up your flaws, understanding that everything will be made open in no time;</blockquote>

		  	<p>It is unimaginable how much atrocity people could commit, in a bid to cover up their evil deeds. It works just like lies; telling a single lie will require about eight more lies to cover it up.</p>
		  	<p>Some people owe their entire lives to blackmailers. They’re being blackmailed for a single deed, yet go bankrupt to cover it up. Sadly, at the end of the day, the truth will prevail. After all, nothing is hidden under the sun.</p>
		  	<p>This particularly leaves me wondering why sin should be covered up with sin.</p>
		  	<p>The crime David committed in trying to cover up his evil deed was more evil than the initial deed on its own. God was not angry with him for his initial flaw, but for the extent he went in evil, in an attempt to conceal the truth.</p>
		  	<p>Not only did he impregnate another man’s wife, he tried to conceal that by persuading the man, Uriah to go lay with his wife. When that attempt to conceal the truth failed a couple of times, he arranged his death.</p>
		  	<p>What would have been the worst that could have happened to David if he opened up? Was the shame really worth someone’s life?</p>
		  	<p>What David failed to understand is that the truth will always prevail! When it did prevail, David did not only lose his reputation, but his son as well.</p>
		  	<p>Trying to cover up will always result in loss of resources, lives or even reputation. Save yourself the loss by opening up; what is the worst that could be done to you for admitting your flaws?</p>
		  	<p>Are the blackmailers really worth going bankrupt for? The earlier you realize that the truth, which you pay them to conceal, will eventually be made open soon, the more loss you save yourself.</p>
		  	<p>Man is liable to flaws; we’ve all made mistakes previously. Admitting your wrongs, and making up for it with right, will always grant you peace within</p>
		  	<p>I believe David must have been ripped off his peace, the moment he began to perpetrate evil against Uriah. Trying to cover up your deeds through wrong means will always rip you off your peace, resources, strength and reputation.</p>
		  	<p>Always be mindful of the extent you go to cover up your flaws, understanding that everything will be made open in no time; for truth is a light, which darkness can never eclipse. Be blessed!</p>
