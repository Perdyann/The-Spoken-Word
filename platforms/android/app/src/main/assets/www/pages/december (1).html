		  	<p><i>Now faith is the substance of things hoped for, the evidence of things not seen. (Hebrews 11:1)</i></p>
		  	

		  	<blockquote>Faith is the substance of hope; when there is no hope, faith has no substance. </blockquote>

		  	<p>Faith is the substance, evidence, assurance and confirmation of things hoped for. When nothing has been hoped for, then there’s nothing to be confirmed, thus there is no faith.</p>
		  	<p>Hope comes before faith; when there has been no hope, there can be no faith. The value of faith is hope; without hope, faith is worthless!</p>
		  	<p>Hope is the desire, expectation and anticipation of something; on its own, there is no power. This is because, we can desire something, but still not have it. Therefore, when hope has been manifested, faith comes to give it life.</p>
		  	<p>Faith is the fertilizer of hope. When a seed of hope is planted, it remains futile, until it is made fertile by faith. Likewise, the fertilizer (faith) is of no point, when there is no plant to use it on.</p>
		  	<p>In order to be productive, we must first start with hope, and then constantly fertilize our hope with faith.</p>
		  	<p>Faith is the substance of hope; when there is no hope (expectation or desire), there is nothing to have faith about.</p>
		  	<p>Beloved, the journey of faith begins with hope. Your faith cannot be effective when hope has not been planted. In order for you to receive results, you must start by having an expectation or desire.</p>
		  	<p>Concerning Abraham, it is written:</p>
		  	<p><i><b>Who against hope believed in hope,</b> that he might become the father of many nations, according to that which was spoken, So shall thy seed be. (Romans 4:18)</i></p>
		  	<p>Even in the most hopeless situation, Abraham decided to keep hoping. Even when he and his wife, Sarah, were aged, and it became naturally impossible for them to have a child, he still hoped to be the father of many nations. In no time, Faith fertilized his hope.</p>
		  	<p>If he never had that desire, expectation and anticipation, faith would have been void.</p>
		  	<p>Why is Abraham often referred to as the legend of Faith? He first believed in hope against hope. If he had not hope, he couldn’t have exhibited any faith.</p>
		  	<p>Why did the woman with an issue of blood touch the garment of Jesus? She first hoped that if she could touch is garment, she will be healed. Now, when she actually touched the garment, that hope was fertilized by faith, and as a result, she was healed. (Luke 8:43-48)</p>
		  	<p>If she never hoped that she will be healed, she wouldn’t have bothered to press through the crowd, to touch the garment of Jesus. Beloved, if you read that passage, you’d realize that a whole crowd thronged about Jesus; therefore, many other people must have been touching his garment, but received no result.</p>
		  	<p>Of all the people that touched his garment, she was the only one that received healing, because she touched it with an expectation—hope. Faith is the substance of hope; when there is no hope, faith has no substance.</p>
		  	<p>Beloved, in order to build a mansion of faith; start by laying a foundation of hope, for hope is the value of faith. Be blessed!</p>
