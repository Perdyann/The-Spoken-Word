		  	<p><i>And we know that all things work together for good to them that love God, to them who are the called according to his purpose. (Romans 8:28)</i></p>
		  


		  	<blockquote>From the shells of total shame, and from the marrows of the utmost disgrace, God can still birth fame.</blockquote>

		  	<p>When we journey on a route that’s not quite familiar to us, we most times use a satellite navigation system to give us directions to our intended destination.</p>
		  	<p>Have you ever noticed that whenever we act contrary to the direction of the Satellite Navigator, for instance, if we navigate left, when we should have gone right, the Navigator does not direct us backwards, but automatically uses our mistakes to plan the next available route?</p>
		  	<p>That’s just the way things work out for those that love God, who are called according to his purpose. Even our mistakes work out for our good! You might have lost your job, cars, home and all you’ve got. I am not surprised to know that even the loss may eventually turn out for your good. I once heard someone say, “thank God I lost that job; perhaps, if I didn’t lose it, a job as conducive as my present one, may not have emerged.” Beloved, in whatever situation you’re facing now, trust God to make a message out of your mess.</p>
		  	<p>David was one of a kind; the man after God’s own heart. He’s perfect for this context; he was someone who loved God, and was called according to his purpose. However, there came a time in his life, where he was not sensitive enough to the seasons, and as a result, he fell. When Kings were at war, in the centre of an assignment, David was asleep spiritually, and so, he was enticed by the body of Bathsheba.</p>
		  	<p>That was the beginning of his fall. Having a carnal knowledge of Bathsheba lured him further into temptation, as he had to go an extra-mile to cover up for his iniquities. It was a shameful state! It was a shame upon him and his personality. Guess what? When David was able to humble himself to the Lord, and seek mercy, the Lord turned everything round for his good.</p>
		  	<p>Even though he lost his first child from Bathsheba, something greater was birthed from that shame. Indeed, out of the shame, emerged fame. Bathsheba took in again, and bore Solomon (The wisest man).</p>
		  	<p>It is amazing to fathom the fact that it is still through the womb of Bathsheba that Solomon was born. It is great to comprehend the truth that it is still through the affair of David and Bathsheba that Solomon emerged.</p>
		  	<p>From the shells of total shame, and from the marrows of the utmost disgrace, God can still birth fame. God blessed Solomon like He had never done before. He said, <i> “so that there was none like thee before thee, neither after thee shall any arise like unto thee.” (1 Kings 3:12).</i> Solomon’s wisdom made room for him. Queen of Sheba visited Solomon. He was that famous. Indeed, out of shame, was birthed fame.</p>
		  	<p>Beloved, there is no situation that God cannot turn around for our good; not even our mistakes! Today, every record that has ever stood against you will begin to act in your favor in Jesus name. Amen!</p>
