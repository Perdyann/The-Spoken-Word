		  	<p><i>“... ye fall down and worship the image which I have made; well: but if ye worship not, ye shall be cast the same hour into the midst of a burning fiery furnace; and who is that God that shall deliver you out of my hands?</i></p>
		  	<p><i>Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, answered and said to the king, O Nebuchadnezzar, we are not careful to answer thee in this matter.</i></p>
		  	<p><i>If it be so, our God whom we serve is able to deliver us from the burning fiery furnace, and he will deliver us out of thine hand, O king.</i></p>
		  	<p><i>But if not, be it known unto thee, O king, that we will not serve thy gods, nor worship the golden image which thou hast set up.” (Daniel 3:15-18)</i></p>

		  	<blockquote>The cheapest and poorest man on earth is not the man that lacks finances, but he, who has no standard. </blockquote>

		  	<p>What kept Shedrach, Meshach, and Abednego standing, even when all others were ignorantly bowing? What gave them so much courage to neglect the King’s order? What instilled in them so much trust and confidence in God that they were willing to give up their lives?</p>
		  	<p>These fellows set a standard in God, that they were not willing to compromise. The cheapest and poorest man on earth is not the man that lacks finances, but he, who has no standard.</p>
		  	<p>Until you build a standard, you could easily be bought over with cheap ideas, thus, you remain like a man, founded on sinking sand... so unstable!</p>
		  	<p>Shedrach, Meshach and Abednego, did not stop at building any standard, but they ensured it was right, and founded on God. That was what gave them so much courage to neglect the Kings order, at the expense of their lives. It instilled faith, trust and confidence in them.</p>
		  	<p>Beloved, if you don’t want to fall a prey so easily to the vices of the enemy in this world, set a standard. Build your character!</p>
		  	<p>It is not enough to hope not to indulge in pre-marital sex, make it a standard. Build your character! Quit any un-godly relationship.</p>
		  	<p>It is not enough to hope not to get drunk again, make it a standard. Build your character! Get rid of any alcohol in your possession, never taste it again.</p>
		  	<p>It is not enough to hope not to smoke cigarettes or take drugs again, make it a standard. Build your character! Get rid of any cigarettes or drugs in your possession.</p>
		  	<p>If your laptop, internet, or anything else will lure you to watching pornography, get rid of it!</p>
		  	<p><i>I made a covenant with mine eyes; why then should I think upon a maid? (Job 31:1)</i></p>
		  	<p>Job was one of a kind, who went as far as making a covenant with God, to a certain end.</p>
		  	<p>My vision is more precious to me than any temporal pleasure of the flesh. Joseph’s vision was more precious to him than the cuddling of Potiphar’s wife.</p>
		  	<p>Beloved, there are so many things in the world, which have been carefully designed by the enemy to lure a believer to derail. However, if we, like Shedrach, Meshach and Abednego, have a standard in God, we will neither bow nor compromise for anything less. It is written:</p>
		  	<p><i>And be not conformed to this world: but be ye transformed by the renewing of your mind, that ye may prove what is that good, and acceptable, and perfect, will of God. (Romans 12:2)</i></p>
		  	<p>Indeed, we are in the world, but not of the world. It is an error for us to conform to the worldly standards. The world should conform to our own standards.</p>
		  	<p>We are made to influence and transform the world from deep within. Someone needs to make this decision in God today, “I will not bow, come what may, and I will not compromise my stands!” Be blessed!</p>
