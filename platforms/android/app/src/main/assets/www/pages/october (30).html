		  	<p><i>But he that is spiritual judgeth all things, yet he himself is judged of no man. (1 Corinthians 2:15)</i></p>
		  

		  	<blockquote>The world can have its opinion, but it is left for spiritual men to make conclusions. </blockquote>

		  	<p>The meaning of the word, “judgeth” is to define, conclude, decide, rate, access and have the final say over every situation. In essence, the spiritual man defines every situation, but is defined by no man. As a spiritual man, you have the final say over every situation.</p>
		  	<p>We have the ability to call things that be not as though they were; it is our decision, assessment and conclusion that stands. The world can have its opinion, but it is left for spiritual men to make conclusions.</p>
		  	<p>According to the diagnoses of the Doctor, you might have a terminal ailment, but remember—you have the final say. When your account manager says your account is red, you can choose to call it green.</p>
		  	<p>We can judge all things, but we can never be judged by anyone. In essence, we can make decisions on all worldly situations, but the world can never decide our own stand.</p>
		  	<p>Seeing then, that we have the ability to judge all things, without being judged, what manner of life ought we to live? We can define our days, rate our lives, and have the final say over every affair; let us redeem this opportunity.</p>
		  	<p>Why do you have bad, hectic and poor days? You never judged your day. Why was your performance poor? You never defined it. Why didn’t that situation act in your favor? You never made the decision.</p>
		  	<p>If you had been careful to rate, access, decide, define and order your affairs, you would have had a better situation. It is not too late to make judgments and conclusions.</p>
		  	<p>When you wake up in the morning, order your day by speaking spirit-filled words of faith. As you judge your day, declaring that it shall be great, it will have no other choice than to heed to the words of a spiritual man.</p>
		  	<p>I keep saying, “I shall never know lack a day in my life. I am a success, I cannot fail. Life is acting in my favor. I am going higher everyday ...” These are not mere confessions, but the judgments and conclusions of a Spiritual man.</p>
		  	<p>Life is not unfair, neither is it difficult, tough or hard; it is only acting based on your judgment. If you can judge rightly, you will live right.</p>
		  	<p>People say, “Life is not a bed of roses”, that’s their own judgment about life. You can choose to define your own life as a bed of roses, and that is what it becomes.</p>
		  	<p>If you decide now, to make positive judgments, decisions, and conclusions, even over the minutest aspect of your life, you will soar on heights that no man has ever reached. Be blessed!</p>
