		  	<blockquote>If you desire to be used by God, then get ready to be taken advantage of, without complaining.</blockquote>

		  	<p>There was a service I reluctantly attended sometime ago, I may not have received anything tangible, but one thing outstanding, which changed my motive about walking with God. This was the understanding of what it really means to be used by God.</p>
		  	<p>I had done all that could possibly be done to ensure that everything was intact for a perfect service. I made some necessary documents available, struggled to locate the venue in the cold and in the rain... Had to stand almost throughout the entire service, and I had to run errands that cold night, I could barely sit down and concentrate on the message.</p>
		  	<p>Everyone had a swell time, and got to meet each other at the end of the day. They were some little things which I expected, at least, to be done for me, having served over the years. I needed a little bit of support from the ministry... At least, the announcement of my upcoming program. I endured the stress all through the program, and at the end, not one of my expectations were met.</p>
		  	<p>As I strolled back home in the cold rainy night, moving without an umbrella or poncho in such a season and time, my heart was much colder than the winter. But even as I thought of my expectations, God began to deal with me. He started, “Do you really know what it means to be used?”, and “Haven’t you prayed me to use you?” Just then, I reflected on an aspect of the sermon that was given that night. God said to me, “Zuriel, you were just used!”</p>
		  	<p>When a man gets in a relationship with a lady, and uses her to satisfy his sexual gains, we say to the lady, “He is just using you!” When we pick up a clean container, and serve a meal in it, we eat to our satisfaction, not bothering about the container. After all, we only wanted to use it to feed ourselves.</p>
		  	<p>What it means for God to use you is for you to be taken advantage of. It is not just about what you stand to gain, but what you have to go through to the glory of God. It is not just about your comfort, but the sacrifice you have to make for the Works of the Father to be fulfilled.</p>
		  	<p><i>He who is faithful in a very little [thing] is faithful also in much, and he who is dishonest and unjust in a very little [thing] is dishonest and unjust also in much. (Luke 16:10).</i></p>
		  	<p>If you cannot be freely used for little chores, don’t expect God to entrust dynamic kingdom mandates into your hands. If you desire to be used by God, then get ready to be taken advantage of, without complaining. Get ready to be used for God’s glory, even if there’s no gain on your side (although there is). It is a privilege to be used by God. Stop complaining, and count it all joy!</p>
