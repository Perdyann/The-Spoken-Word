		  	<p><i>“Woe to the world for temptations to sin! For it is necessary that temptations come, but woe to the one by whom the temptation comes! (Matthew 18:7)</i></p>


		  	<blockquote>Of what value is your income, when God is against the source?</blockquote>

		  	<p>In the world, temptations are bound to come, to try those who dwell therein; but temptations do not create themselves, there must be channels through which they come.</p>
		  	<p>It is boldly quoted, <i> but woe to the one by whom the temptation comes! </i> Verily, the issue is not the existence of temptation, but the channels that bring them forth.</p>
		  	<p>It is common for many people to read through this scripture, without really noticing anything, but meditating deeper through the lines, we get to balance it with our lives, and get a personal message from it.</p>
		  	<p>Sometimes, even as Christians, we might unknowingly be a channel of temptation; we try as much as possible not to yield to temptations, but we unconsciously lure people into it.</p>
		  	<p>The truth, which our conditions might keep us from receiving, is—not all jobs are appropriate for Sons of God—some people understand how inappropriate their jobs are, yet, because that is their only source of income, they refuse to give it up.</p>
		  	<p>Of what value is your income, when God is against the source? </p>
		  	<p>When I think of the woes of a man that ushers in temptation; I feel sorry for him. Why accept contracts to design pornographic websites?</p>
		  	<p>Why start up a business that promotes drunkenness, fornication, and all sorts of immorality? Why publish magazines that display evil? Why get yourself involved in the production of a pornographic movie? You might not be the actor, but the costumier, location manager, etc... there is no difference between you both. A man of purpose does not embrace every opportunity, but chooses his contract wisely!</p>
		  	<p>Does it ever occur to you that in all these, you are serving as a channel that ushers temptation? Have you thought of what impact your actions have on the moral decadence in the society?</p>
		  	<p>No matter how enticing an offer to compromise your faith looks, if it in any way makes you a channel of temptation, turn it down!</p>
		  	<p>Beloved, we might not officially be involved in any job or career that makes us compromise, but have you thought of the impact of your speech, lifestyle, and actions?</p>
		  	<p>As much as I would love to give you the words you might desire to hear today, there is an issue that has to be settled! You cannot pray to God and expect everything to be alright, when you are daily connected in any way to ushering temptation.</p>
		  	<p>Rather than being a channel of temptation, be a channel of edification. Transfer your strength, words, resources and passion towards being a blessing to the world.</p>
		  	<p>Rather than tempt someone today, be a blessing to the nation. Be blessed!</p>
