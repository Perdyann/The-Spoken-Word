		  <div class="panel-body" style="text-align:justify">


		  	<p><i>And Lot lifted up his eyes, and beheld all the plain of Jordan, that it was well watered every where, before the Lord destroyed Sodom and Gomorrah, even as the garden of the Lord, like the land of Egypt, as thou comest unto Zoar.</i></p>
		  	<p><i>Then Lot chose him all the plain of Jordan; and Lot journeyed east: and they separated themselves the one from the other. (Genesis 13:10-11)</i></p>


		  	<blockquote>When you are prompted to make decisions based on feelings, you can easily derail from purpose. </blockquote>

		  	<p>A man ceases to live an ordinary life, when he quits operating by his human senses, and embrace revelation. Until you are led by revelation, you cannot dwell in God’s Realm of Life.</p>
		  	<p>There are a couple of lessons to be learnt from the mistakes and choices of Lot. When Lot and Abraham could no longer dwell together, and they both agreed to separate, I expected Lot to leave the choice to his uncle and leader—Abraham, but no! He gladly decided to have the first pick.</p>
		  	<p>That was his first, but not his major mistake. Lot did not make a choice as the Spirit led him to, but as his senses propelled him to. He was led to make a choice by what he saw, and perceived to be a land with great prospects.</p>
		  	<p>Never be moved by what you see, if at all you move, let it be as a result of the leading of the Holy Spirit, and not your human senses. When you are prompted to make decisions based on feelings, you can easily derail from purpose.</p>
		  	<p>As great and watered as the land looked, the Lord was displeased with its inhabitants. It matters a lot where you are going to.</p>
		  	<p>Notice that as soon as Lot left Abraham, the Lord gave to Abraham all that his eyes could see. In essence, as he looked to the north, south, east and west, including the land Lot chose, they all became his to possess.</p>
		  	<p>Whereas, Lot was driven out of the place he chose, and commanded not to look back. In essence, Lot’s vision was limited and restricted, whereas Abraham was empowered to possess everything by his vision.</p>
		  	<p>It is obvious that the greatest limitation of any man is his senses; when a man is led by his senses, he encounters limits and restrictions from all spheres.</p>
		  	<p>Furthermore, when destruction came upon the city Lot chose, and the angel commanded him to run to the mountain, he insisted on taking refuge elsewhere. (Genesis 19:17-10) That portrays the extent to which Lot was unwilling to be directed by the Lord.</p>
		  	<p>That same mountain, which he refused running to initially, was where he ended up running to afterwards (Genesis 19:30). In essence, a realm that could have taken him a day to attain, eventually took him months to reach.</p>
		  	<p>Beloved, save yourself unnecessary delays and oppositions, by yielding to the voice of the Lord. Your feelings are bound to change over time, but the Word of the Lord does not fail; don’t be led by your temporal feelings, but by revelation from the Word of God. Be blessed!</p>
