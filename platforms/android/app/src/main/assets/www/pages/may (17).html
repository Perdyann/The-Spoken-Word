		  	<p><i>Rejoice evermore. Pray without ceasing. In every thing give thanks: for this is the will of God in Christ Jesus concerning you. (1 Thessalonians 5:16-18)</i></p>


		  	<blockquote>Until you are able to walk in these – Increasing joy, constant prayers in the Word, and unconditional thanksgiving – you are yet to discover God’s perfect will for your life.</blockquote>

		  	<p>Have you ever wondered what God’s will for your life is? You might have thought about your purpose and assignment on earth; you might have been through a tough stage of decision making. At this juncture, all you can think about is, “what is God’s will?”</p>
		  	<p>There are decisions I wanted to make in life, but decided to wait until I’m sure it’s the will of God for me. As much as Jesus wanted the cup to pass Him by, He also wanted to remain in the will of the Father (Matthew 26:39).</p>
		  	<p>Here’s a passage that directly reveals God’s will for our lives. Rejoice evermore! The use of the term ‘evermore’ portrays that we should constantly increase in joy. In essence, the way you rejoiced yesterday should be nothing compared to your level of joy today.</p>
		  	<p>Beloved, the joy of the Lord is our strength (Nehemiah 8:10). The more we increase in joy, the more we wax stronger in Spirit.</p>
		  	<p>Furthermore, God wants us, in all season, to pray without ceasing. Don’t just be satisfied that you prayed today, ensure you keep the fire burning. Pray with meditation, and Rhema. Praying in line with God’s Word defines an effective prayer.</p>
		  	<p>Get rid of anything that will paralyze your prayer life. When you pray in the Holy Ghost, you are edified and strengthened from within. Never cease to pray!</p>
		  	<p>Finally, we are admonished to give thanks in everything. I love the use of the term ‘in everything’. We should not just be thankful when God grants our request, but when He turns it down. I thank God for not giving me that job when I wanted it.</p>
		  	<p>Beloved, all things works together for good. If you get the job, it’s for good; if you don’t get it, it’s still for your good. If you get the contract, it’s for good; if you don’t get it, it’s still for your good. So give thanks in everything.</p>
		  	<p>When Joseph’s brothers sold him, Joseph did not understand the benefit then, he probably felt betrayed, but soon he realized the good in it; they were releasing him to the place of his assignment. We might not be able to see the benefits of everything now, but soon you will understand that it happened for your good.</p>
		  	<p>When your boss in the office is being mean like Joseph’s brothers, give thanks; it’s for your good.</p>
		  	<p>God will never withhold anything good from us (Psalms 84:11); therefore, whatsoever was withheld from you is not good enough for you. Give thanks!</p>
		  	<p>Until you are able to walk in these—Increasing joy, constant prayers in the Word, and unconditional thanksgiving—you are yet to discover God’s perfect will for your life.</p>
		  	<p>Beloved, when you are in a situation of decision making, and you are wondering what God’s will is; dedicate quality time to meditate on God’s Word, and pray in the Holy Ghost, with a joyful and thankful heart. God speaks!</p>
		  	<p>God’s purpose and ideal plan for your life is only revealed when you deliberately walk in these virtues. In discovering God, you discover His perfect will for your life. Be blessed!</p>
