		  <div class="panel-body" style="text-align:justify">


		  	<p><i>Who comforteth us in all our tribulation, that we may be able to comfort them which are in any trouble, by the comfort wherewith we ourselves are comforted of God. (2 Corinthians 1:4)</i></p>
		  

		  	<blockquote>We can never teach people how to swim out of an ocean, when we have never been in a pool of water. </blockquote>

		  	<p>Anyone, who ever told you that being born-again will exempt you from tribulation, lied. Challenges are bound to be faced by everyone, irrespective of their spiritual status. The only difference is that Sons of God are born champions.</p>
		  	<p>The Word of God makes us to understand that we will always be challenged, and we will always overcome. We will always go through the fire, but still be released into a wealthy place. Troubles don’t last always!</p>
		  	<p>God will never leave you uncomforted in any tribulation; He is our ever present help in times of trouble.</p>
		  	<p>Many friends will escort you to the war-front, but not many will be willing to fight with you. God is the only one, who is constantly present, even in times of trouble.</p>
		  	<p>So often I wondered, “Why do Christians still face tribulations? Why do we even have troubles anyways?” I believe if there were no troubles, there’d be no need for any ‘ever present help’</p>
		  	<p>In no time I realized one thing—we can never show people the way out of a wilderness, which we have never gone through. We can never teach people how to swim out of an ocean, when we have never been in a pool of water.</p>
		  	<p>In order to comfort anyone, we must have gone through their sort of challenge. In order to lead people out of their mess, we must have been caught up in such a mess before. If you’ve never been tried, you can never be useful!</p>
		  	<p>We all desire to be an inspiration to people; we desire to help people in their times of trouble and tribulation. But we fail to realize that we cannot help people out of trouble if we have never been in trouble before.</p>
		  	<p>When Jesus told us that in this world we would face persecutions, He comforted us saying that we should take heart, for He has overcome (John 16:33). This simply shows that He has also faced persecution, even before us. If He had never been persecuted, He might not have been able to comfort us.</p>
		  	<p>Here’s the point, there’s a reason why you are going through all that you face. When we are tried and persecuted, the Holy Spirit is present to give us Words of comfort and hope. When we have overcome those trials through the Holy Spirit, and we encounter people with similar problems tomorrow, it will be easier for us to comfort them in the same way, which we have been comforted.</p>
		  	<p>We cannot lead anyone through a route, which we are not familiar with. Kenneth Hagin was terminally ill at a tender age of 17, through his illness; he encountered the healing hands of God. As a result, he extended that healing to as many as he came across for many decades.</p>
		  	<p>If he had not walked through that bridge, he could never have led anyone through it. The tribulation had a Divine purpose.</p>
		  	<p>Don’t be saddened because you are caught up in an ill situation; just understand that your ill situation holds the answer to the questions of many generations after you. Be blessed!</p>
