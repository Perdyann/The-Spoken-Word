		  	<p><i>And take the helmet of salvation, and the sword of the Spirit, which is the word of God: (Ephesians 6:17)</i></p>
	

		  	<blockquote>The most miserable people on earth are those, who are ignorant of God’s Word – the enemy rules over them. </blockquote>

		  	<p>The Word of God is described as the sword of the Spirit; it is indeed our sword. A man does not appear on the battle field without the sword; likewise, we cannot be victorious in the good fight of faith, without the Word of God.</p>
		  	<p>The Word of God is our authority; it is the origin of faith in God. Previously, we studied the importance of taking the shield of faith, above all other weapons. However, we must understand that the origin of faith is the Word of God; thus, when we lack knowledge of God’s Word, we cannot effectively take the shield of faith.</p>
		  	<p>Faith comes by hearing the Word of God; if there is no Word of God to be heard, then there cannot be any faith in God. Faith is only stirred and propelled by inner promptings from the Word of God.</p>
		  	<p>A believer is born for exploits! Even the least believer is above sickness, by virtue of his new birth. However, judging based on earthly realities; it is obvious that a lot of believers are living way beyond their Divine Status.</p>
		  	<p>So often, I wonder why some believers are limited by worldly rules, systems and principles; but I realized one thing—ignorance of the Word!</p>
		  	<p>A lot of believers spend months without meditation on God’s Word. How do they expect to be victorious? Seeing that faith is the victory that overcomes the world, and its origin is the Word of God, we can conclude that a victorious life cannot be lived outside God’s Word.</p>
		  	<p>Never spend a day, without meditating on God’s Word; never spend a day without receiving an insight from God’s Word. His Word cannot be exhausted!</p>
		  	<p>I have read many novels and finished them in days; I have read many articles and had enough of them within weeks. But not even eternity is enough to summarize God’s Word; there is always something new I see every time I meditate on His Word; the revelations just get newer and more refreshing by the days.</p>
		  	<p>The Word of God is sharper than two edged sword (Hebrews 4:12); it is the sword of the Spirit. When the enemy confronts you with marital, academic or social problems, present him a Word solution.</p>
		  	<p>When the enemy confronted Jesus with temptations, Jesus replied with nothing else, but the Word.</p>
		  	<p>There is no problem that lacks a Word solution; all that you ever need in your life is contained in the Word. It is our sword. The most miserable people on earth are those, who are ignorant of the Word of God—the enemy rules over them.</p>
		  	<p>Little wonder the scripture states that people perish because of lack of knowledge — ignorance (Hosea 4:6). Except the Word of God is heard and known, faith cannot come; and except faith comes, victory cannot be achieved.</p>
		  	<p>It is now obvious that our victory is in every way linked to the Word of God.</p>
		  	<p>It is heart aching to know that many believers still go through needless pains and struggles, simply because they lack knowledge of God’s Word. Life is spiritual; its battles are not carnal — take the sword of the Spirit, and live the victorious life. Be blessed!</p>
