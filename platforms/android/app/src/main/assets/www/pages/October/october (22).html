		  	<p><i>And, behold, I am with thee, and will keep thee in all places whither thou goest, and will bring thee again into this land; for I will not leave thee, until I have done that which I have spoken to thee of. (Genesis 28:15)</i></p>
		  	

		  	<blockquote>The Word of God cannot fail; when there is nothing else to hold on to, stick to the Word.</blockquote>

		  	<p>After Jacob had laid his head on stones, and began to sleep, God blessed him. It is important to note that God concluded the blessings with an assurance that He will never leave until there is a manifestation of all His Spoken Words.</p>
		  	<p>Verily, God’s Word cannot be void; if there is one thing, which we are repeatedly assured of, in the scriptures, regarding the words of God, it is certainly a manifestation. Until His Words are accomplished, they cannot fail or pass away.</p>
		  	<p>I am yet to see a Word, uttered by God, which was not manifested in the life of them, to whom it was spoken. When God made promises to Abraham, all of them were accomplished; the blessings He uttered to Jacob in his dreams were all manifested.</p>
		  	<p>Never (not even once), has the Lord gone back on His Word; if He will not favor you for anything, He will do it for the sake of His Word because He can never go back on His Word.</p>
		  	<p>Has God said it? Then He will do it! We can only be concerned about it not being fulfilled if God never said it; but as long as He has said it, it is blessed to be fulfilled against all odds.</p>
		  	<p>The Spoken Word of God remains irrevocable! Rhema means the Spoken Word of God. Judging based on this scripture; we can conclude that it is impossible for Rhema to fail.</p>
		  	<p>Even if you will not receive anything else in any season, receive Rhema always. Never go through any season without a Rhema to back it up.</p>
		  	<p>When I look back at seasons in my life when tremendous successes were recorded, I could only attribute it to the level of revelation and Rhema I constantly received and declared in that season.</p>
		  	<p>Beloved for every situation you face in life, there is a Rhema solution. If you can just locate that One Word of God, and personalize it, declaring it in your situation day and night, you are bound to receive glorious manifestations.</p>
		  	<p>Never cease to meditate intently on the Word, never cease to receive Rhema, and never cease to declare it day and night. It is a season for the manifestation of God’s Spoken Words.</p>
		  	<p>The Word of God cannot fail; when there is nothing else to hold on to, stick to the Word. Those Words and Prophecies spoken over your life might have tarried; but in this season, there is a set manifestation for every Word of God. Receive it, and be blessed!</p>
