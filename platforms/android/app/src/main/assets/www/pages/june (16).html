		  	<p><i>And let us consider and give attentive, continuous care to watching over one another, studying how we may stir up (stimulate and incite) to love and helpful deeds and noble activities, (Hebrews 10:24)</i></p>
		  	

		  	<blockquote>We cannot lead anyone to a realm that we have not reached; we cannot lead anyone to the light that we do not shine. </blockquote>

		  	<p>Naturally, the heart of man is selfish, but that ceases to be the case of a man who has received the Holy Ghost . . . It is quite ordinary for us to be very much concerned about our affairs, but to what extent are we concerned about the affairs of everyone else?</p>
		  	<p>It is easy for someone to pay attention, and devote efforts and resources continuously to caring for his family needs, ensuring that nothing is lacking. But to what extent do we pay attention and show care to our neighborsâ€™, who are not directly related to us?</p>
		  	<p>Today, we are admonished to watch over, edify and encourage one another to show love and do good works.</p>
		  	<p>It is not enough that I should decide to love and do good; but I should go further to encourage as many people as I can, to love and perform good deeds.</p>
		  	<p>Observe that before we are admonished to stimulate others to love, we are encouraged to show loving care. This goes a long way to portray that we cannot encourage anyone to love and be good, if we are not loving and good.</p>
		  	<p>It is your acts of love towards people that will convince them to show love towards others. I cannot tell anyone to love, when I do not love. I cannot convince anyone to be good, when I am caught up in evil. I cannot encourage anyone to be in the light, when I am walking in the dark.</p>
		  	<p>Your lifestyle is the sermon and gospel unbelievers watch and listen to. Little wonder it is written:</p>
		  	<p><i>Let your light so shine before men, that they may see your good works, and glorify your Father which is in heaven. (Matthew 5:16)</i></p>
		  	<p>Before men will get to glorify our Father in heaven, they will have to see your good works. Before your good works can be noticed, your light will have to shine.</p>
		  	<p>It is very obvious that we cannot lead anyone to a realm that we have not reached; we cannot lead anyone to the light that we do not shine.</p>
		  	<p>As we are admonished today to encourage one another to show love and good deeds, let us allow this message to first go through us.</p>
		  	<p>Do something to bless your world; live a life that will inspire and lead everyone to Christ. There are men who died centuries ago, but their biographies are still winning souls.</p>
		  	<p>Beloved, make a decision today, to live a life that is worth emulating; live a life that attracts all men to the glory of God; and encourage one another to love, by being an epitome of love. Be blessed!</p>
