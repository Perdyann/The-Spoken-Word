		  	<p><i>If anyone thinks he is religious and does not bridle his tongue but deceives his heart, this person’s religion is worthless. (James 1:26 ESV)</i></p>
		  	


		  	<blockquote>The major changes in the life of a man, begins with changes in his manner of speech. If you have not learnt how to tame your tongue, you have not started living yet.</blockquote>

		  	<p>A bridle is a headgear used to control a horse, to which a bit and reins are attached. Just like the horses are controlled and guided by the bridle, so should your tongue be controlled, your speech seasoned, and your words edifying.</p>
		  	<p>As some versions rightly quote, “If your tongue is out of control, you are fooling yourself.” You might think yourself a spiritual man, but when your tongue is out of control, you are merely languishing in folly.</p>
		  	<p>When you get born-again, one of the effects of the Holy Spirit in you, as you grow, is a change in your vocabulary.</p>
		  	<p>The song-writer rightly states, “ ... the things I used to say, I say them no more. There’s a great change since I’m born again.”</p>
		  	<p>The way Saul spoke before his conversion and encounter at Damascus is obviously different from the way he spoke afterwards. He had to align his speech to the Word of God.</p>
		  	<p>There are some things that are not convenient for my mouth to utter, no matter how hard I try. The major changes in the life of a man, begins with changes in his manner of speech. A man can never be right, without speaking right.</p>
		  	<p>James 3:3-5 gives us an understanding; just as little bits controls the entire body of a horse, a little hem controls a humongous ship, and a little fire lit with a small lighter could cause great burns, the tongue which is an unnoticed small part of the body, could cause great havoc.</p>
		  	<p>Verily, the tongue, as small as it is, controls the entire body and life of a man. Little wonder the Word says,</p>
		  	<p><i>Death and life are in the power of the tongue: and they that love it shall eat the fruit thereof. (Proverbs 18:21)</i></p>
		  	<p>Your tongue can either bear you the fruit of death, or life. The tongue can give life and death as well. The choice is yours.</p>
		  	<p>By taming your tongue, and aligning it with the Word of God; by speaking and confessing positive words; by declaring God’s Word over every situation; your life is gradually shaped and modeled for greatness.</p>
		  	<p>However, when your tongue is out of control; when you constantly meditate on, and speak defiled words; when you speak the language of the world; your life is channeled towards death and destruction. Little wonder it is said:</p>
		  	<p><i>What man is he that desireth life, and loveth many days, that he may see good?</i></p>
		  	<p><i>Keep thy tongue from evil, and thy lips from speaking guile. (Psalms 34:12-13)</i></p>
		  	<p>If indeed you desire long life, here’s a simple tip—tame your tongue and speak right.</p>
		  	<p>Kings don’t speak like mere masses, because they know the power contained in their words. When a mere man is transformed to a King, he is expected to get rid of his former manner of speech.</p>
		  	<p>For every level of promotion, your confession should change.</p>
		  	<p>I always confessed that the Holy Spirit was with me, but within a split second, I increased in revelation; that increase ushered in a new confession that replaced the old. When I realized that the Holy Ghost is not just with me, but resident in me, I began to say, “The Holy Ghost functions in me ...”</p>
		  	<p>When you get born-again, change your speech and ban some words from your vocabulary; when you wax stronger day by day, constantly embrace more powerful confessions.</p>
		  	<p>If you have not learnt how to tame your tongue, you have not started living yet. Be blessed!</p>
