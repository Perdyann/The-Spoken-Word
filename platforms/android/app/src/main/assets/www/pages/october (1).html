		  <div class="panel-body" style="text-align:justify">


		  	<p><i>I have planted, Apollos watered; but God gave the increase. So then neither is he that planteth any thing, neither he that watereth; but God that giveth the increase. (1 Corinthians 3:6-7)</i></p>
		  

		  	<blockquote>Until you drift your focus from men, to God, you can never be a partaker of the Divine Life</blockquote>

		  	<p>Paul, in his first letter to the church in Corinth, spoke against divisions in the body of Christ. According to some of the believers, they were of Paul, and some others claimed to be of Apollos, or of Cephas, while the rest claimed to be of Christ.</p>
		  	<p>Paul gave light to the truth that Christ is not divided; and all of them are only Ministers of the Gospel, of one God.</p>
		  	<p>They had planted and watered, but God gave the increase. They had started up the church, and taught all members the Word of God, but it is God that brought increase and growth.</p>
		  	<p>Some versions portray that neither he, who plants, nor he, who waters is of importance, but he, who causes the seed to grow and increase.</p>
		  	<p>I understand that without increase and growth, planting and watering will be vain. Of what use is it that we labor to plant and water seeds, which cannot grow? The efforts of the Ministers to plant and water the seeds would have been vain, had it not been for the Lord who brought about increase and growth.</p>
		  	<p>Who then should we glory in. God or man? Let us ascribe all glory to Him, who deserves to be glorified, and all praise to Him, who alone deserves our praise.</p>
		  	<p>It is good that the Ministers of the Gospel are respected, and those, who occupy spiritual offices are revered in accordance to their positions. However, let our focus not be drifted from God to man. Let our trust and hope be in God, and not man. Furthermore, Paul says,</p>
		  	<p><i>Therefore let no man glory in men. For all things are yourâ€™s; (1 Corinthians 3:21)</i></p>
		  	<p>There is no man on earth, whom we should boast about; my glory is not in the fact that I have been watered by man, but that I have grown and increased by the Power of God.</p>
		  	<p>Until you drift your focus from men, to God, you can never be a partaker of the Divine Life.</p>
		  	<p>We can relate this instance to the age we are in. There are many churches, ministries and fellowships; in some cases, people, who are members of a particular ministry, despise and criticize the others; some claim to be fans of one Minister or the other, but totally against another.</p>
		  	<p>Over years, many have grown blind to realize that it is not all about the Minister under whom we serve, but God. It is not all about the planter or nurturer, but He, who giveth increase.</p>
		  	<p>Paul attested to the truth that neither him, Apollos or Cephas was crucified for the remission of the sins of the believers, but Jesus. Set your gaze on God and not man. Be blessed!</p>
