		  	<p><i>He that spared not his own Son, but delivered him up for us all, how shall he not with him also freely give us all things? (Romans 8:32)</i></p>
		  

		  	<blockquote>People will easily give out things they don’t need, but find it difficult to sacrifice that, which is so dear to them.</blockquote>

		  	<p>If He could give His Son, what is it that will be too difficult for Him to do? God made the greatest sacrifice, by giving His only begotten Son, who gave up His glory and reputation, came down on earth and took the iniquity of the world upon Him.</p>
		  	<p>He, who knew no sin, became sin for us, that we might be made the righteousness of God (2 Corinthians 5:21). How sacrificial! He redeemed us from the curse of law, by becoming a curse for us (Galatians 3:13). What greater love is there?</p>
		  	<p>If God could give His only begotten Son; If He could sacrifice so much for our sake, why wouldn’t He freely give us all things?</p>
		  	<p>It might be easy to find people who will give you a penny out of their overflowing abundance; it might be easy to find people who will easily give you things that don’t matter to them; it might be easy to see people who will give out clothes and belongings, which they no longer use. But how feasible is it to find someone who will lay down His only beloved Son for your sake?</p>
		  	<p>People will easily give out things they don’t need, but find it difficult to sacrifice that, which is so dear to them. Beloved, Jesus was the only Son of God.</p>
		  	<p>There is a notion that when parents have just one kid, they shower him with much more love than they would have, if they had other kids. A father with many kids might be able to sacrifice one, but not when he is an only child. I can imagine how dear an only child is to his parent.</p>
		  	<p>God made a great sacrifice for us. Here’s the point, by giving His only Son for our sake, it reveals how special we are to Him. If He could freely give us His Son, what else is there, which will be too difficult for Him to give us?</p>
		  	<p>If God could give His Son, He can also give you everything else; if He could give His Son, Divine Health is not too difficult for Him to give. If He could give His Son, no amount of wealth is too difficult for Him to give. If He could give His Son, no situation is too complicated for Him to resolve.</p>
		  	<p>Through the sacrifice of His Son, we are reconciled to Him; how much more will He reconcile our marriages, relationships and issues?</p>
		  	<p>God spared not His Son, but delivered Him up; why then will He not deliver to your hands, that, which you need? Brethren, have this mind set always. Nothing is too difficult for God; He has done the most difficult thing already.</p>
		  	<p>If He could give His Son, He will surely give you all things. Be blessed!</p>
