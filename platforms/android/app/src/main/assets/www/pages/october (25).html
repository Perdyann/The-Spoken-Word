		  	<p><i>Thus saith the Lord the maker thereof, the Lord that formed it, to establish it; the Lord is his name;</i></p>
		  	<p><i>Call unto me, and I will answer thee, and show thee great and mighty things, which thou knowest not. (Jeremiah 33:2-3)</i></p>
		

		  	<blockquote>God will not form that, which He cannot establish. If the creator is God, then the establishment is certain. </blockquote>

		  	<p>The key aspect of focus today will be the phrase, “that formed it, to establish it ...” I need to spare a moment to make it clear that God will not form that, which He cannot establish.</p>
		  	<p>From that phrase, we can conclude that the reason why God formed it is to establish it. As long as He formed it, we are certain that He will establish it.</p>
		  	<p>To form something implies creating it, but to establish something implies setting it up. There is a difference between merely creating an object, and actually setting it up.</p>
		  	<p>To create an object, we simply make it; but setting it up entails planting it in a place of purpose, where it can be fulfilled. It entails fixing it in its place of assignment, and making it useful there.</p>
		  	<p>God did not just create you to exist on the earth, but to be useful, and serve a purpose.</p>
		  	<p>I work in a company that does not just employ individuals, but train them, and set them up in line with the business. By so doing, we are making them aware of the goals, tactics and vision of the company. Thus, the employees are at an advantage as well as the company. They learn new things, acquire new skills and gain working experience, in order to develop their curriculum vitae (CV)</p>
		  	<p>We wouldn’t just employ people, whom we cannot set up. Likewise, God will not just form something, which He cannot establish; He will not create a vessel that He cannot set up in a useful position.</p>
		  	<p>We need to drift our focus from the establishment, to the creator. The truth is that if the creator is God, then the establishment is certain. We can only be worried if we created it of our own will, decisions and opinions.</p>
		  	<p>When you are in a haste to start up things based on your own will, you will be required to establish and sustain it by your effort. But whatsoever you are led by God to start up, will surely be established by God. Here comes the importance of acknowledging God before every step.</p>
		  	<p>We need to get to a level where our only will is for God’s will to be done. Let our will be lost in His.</p>
		  	<p>When I receive new ideas, I’m never worried about whether they’d be established successfully or not. I’m just certain that if the idea is from God, it cannot but be established.</p>
		  	<p>Has he created you? Has He formed your affairs? Then He’d surely establish you! It is written;</p>
		  	<p><i>And even to your old age I am he; and even to hoar hairs will I carry you: I have made, and I will bear; even I will carry, and will deliver you. (Isaiah 46:4)</i></p>
		  	<p>As long as He made you, He will bear, carry and deliver you at all times. Never worry about the success of anything again; just remain certain that the Lord, who made, is faithful enough to establish. Only be led by His Word, and not your will. Be blessed!</p>
