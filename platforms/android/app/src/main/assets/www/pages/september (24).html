		  	<p><i>For a day in Your courts is better than a thousand [anywhere else]; I would rather be a doorkeeper and stand at the threshold in the house of my God than to dwell [at ease] in the tents of wickedness. (Psalm 84:10 AMP)</i></p>
		  

		  	<blockquote>Never give up your real identity, to attain a counterfeit destiny. </blockquote>

		  	<p>Moses had been adopted and catered for by Pharaoh’s daughter; he had everything he desired. Even so, he was unwilling to be called the son of Pharaoh’s daughter.</p>
		  	<p>Rather than dwelling at ease in the tents of wickedness, he chose to stand at the threshold in the house of God. Rather than enjoying the pleasure of sin for a season, he chose to be afflicted along with the people of the Lord. (Hebrews 11:24-25)</p>
		  	<p>It is amazing the extent to which he held on to his real identity, at the expense of a royal name.</p>
		  	<p>Unlike Moses, many have given up their identity in God to obtain temporal pleasures in the tents of wickedness; people have given up their real identity, to attain a counterfeit destiny.</p>
		  	<p>If we were of the world, the world will love us, but we are from a realm higher than the world. Would we rather identify with the system of the world, than represent the interest of the higher realm?</p>
		  	<p>There is pleasure in conforming to worldly standards; there is ease in embracing the corrupt system of the world. However, like Moses did, can we forfeit the temporal pleasures and ease in the tent of the wicked, and choose to retain our identity in Christ?</p>
		  	<p>Moses proved that even without a royal name and diadem, he could still fulfil purpose.</p>
		  	<p>Daniel, Shedrach, Meshach and Abednego turned down the riches, meat, fats and wine the king had to offer, in order to retain their identity in God. They proved that even without being defiled, they could be great.</p>
		  	<p>You can be fulfilled in life, without being a partaker of the ease and temporal pleasures in the tents of wickedness. No matter what happens, retain your identity.</p>
		  	<p>There is no point compromising your stands in order to gain the temporal pleasures of the world; there is no point pursuing worldly agenda’s. Your divine purpose is higher than the best of the worlds’ offer. Be blessed!</p>
