		  	<p><i>Then Nebuchadnezzar the king was astonished, and rose up in haste, and spake, and said unto his counsellors, Did not we cast three men bound into the midst of the fire? They answered and said unto the king, True, O king.</i></p>
		  	<p><i>He answered and said, Lo,  I see four men loose, walking in the midst of the fire, and they have no hurt; and the form of the fourth is like the Son of God. (Daniel 3:24-25)</i></p>
		  

		  	<blockquote>Much more than trials are painful, they are gainful.</blockquote>

		  	<p>Three men were bound and thrown into the fiery furnace, but what Nebuchadnezzar saw was four men loose, and walking in the fire. It is amazing to fathom that the fiery furnace which was heated to consume them, ended up loosing the chains off them.</p>
		  	<p>Before they got into the fire, they were bound; it was not until they were thrown in, that their bonds fell apart, and they became free. There is liberty in the fire!</p>
		  	<p>Before they got into the fire, they were just three; it was not until they were thrown in, that a fourth presence was recognized. There is increase in the fire!</p>
		  	<p>Before they got into the fire, the presence of God was not so visible in their lives; it was not until they were thrown in, that they encountered the very tangible presence of God. God will be right there with you in the fire!</p>
		  	<p>Verily, the fiery furnace, tribulations and trials are not there to break us, but to make us. The fire did not harm them, but gave them that, which they previously lacked. It did not consume them, but set them free. it did not reduce them, but increased their numbers.</p>
		  	<p>Likewise beloved, bear this in mind: much more than trials are painful, they are gainful.</p>
		  	<p>Don’t focus on the heat of the fire, look at the liberty therein; don’t focus on the oppression of the fire, look at the increase therein; don’t focus on the burn, which fire gives, but on the presence it attracts.</p>
		  	<p>When you have set a godly standard, don’t be threatened to compromise your stands, by the sight of the fire; just understand that it cannot burn you, but will definitely bless you.</p>
		  	<p>There is a reason why God allowed you to be thrown into the fire; perhaps, He wants you to feel His presence more tangibly . . . Perhaps, He wants to increase your number. Perhaps, He wants to liberate you.</p>
		  	<p>When you understand the reason why you are in this current season, you will produce exceptional results. Thank God for the season; it’s not here to destroy us, but to build us. Be blessed!</p>
