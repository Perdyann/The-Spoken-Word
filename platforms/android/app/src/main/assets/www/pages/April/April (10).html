		  	<p><i>And as she was going to fetch it, he called to her, and said, Bring me, I pray thee, a morsel of bread in thine hand.</i></p>
		  	<p><i>And she said, As the Lord thy God liveth, I have not a cake, but an handful of meal in a barrel, and a little oil in a cruse: and, behold, I am gathering two sticks, that I may go in and dress it for me and my son, that we may eat it, and die.</i></p>
		  	<p><i>And Elijah said unto her, Fear not; go and do as thou hast said: but make me thereof a little cake first, and bring it unto me, and after make for thee and for thy son.</i></p>
		  	<p><i>For thus saith the Lord God of Israel, The barrel of meal shall not waste, neither shall the cruse of oil fail, until the day that the Lord sendeth rain upon the earth.</i></p>
		  	<p><i>And she went and did according to the saying of Elijah: and she, and he, and her house, did eat many days.</i></p>
		  	<p><i>And the barrel of meal wasted not, neither did the cruse of oil fail, according to the word of the Lord, which he spake by Elijah. (1 Kings 17:11-16)</i></p>

		  	<p>So often, we speak about how blessed the widow was by Elijah’s visit to her home, but we rarely realize how great the price was, which she paid.</p>
		  	<p>Sometimes, it is not so difficult to give, especially when we have in abundance, but we all find it very tasking to sacrifice our last.</p>
		  	<p>The test of Abraham might have been easier if he had many sons, from which he was to offer one. But the magnitude of his trial is spelt by the task of him having to sacrifice a son, through whom the promise of greatness was to be made manifest.</p>
		  	<p>Brethren, this widow’s latter blessing came with a former task. Not many would have qualified for the latter blessing, because the initial task would have put them off.</p>
		  	<p>This widow was not instructed to share her meal with Elijah, but was told to give her very last to him, and rely on God’s Word to sustain her family. In such a time of intense famine, that instruction required faith to obey.</p>
		  	<p>When she gave her last to Elijah, and returned to have at look at her barrel and cruse, she discovered the content was replenished, and so did it last for many days.</p>
		  	<p>Earlier, she might have prayed to God for provision; thus, she was probably hoping to receive, and not to give. God, in His infinite mercies and Wisdom, taught her that it is more blessed to give than to receive. (Acts 20:35)</p>
		  	<p>Beloved, how willing are you to give? When you find yourself in a place of little, are you expecting to receive from someone, or do you ever think of giving?</p>
		  	<p>Many people have given excuses like, “I don’t have anything”, but verily, there is no one without anything to give; if not money, services; if not services, talents; if not talent, love; there must be something! Don’t be too scared to invest your last, for the blessing is only propelled by giving.</p>
		  	<p>When you need a blessing, rather than wait to receive it, give. Giving prompts a blessing more than receiving does. Her miracle was propelled by her faith, which prompted her willingness and ability to give.</p>
		  	<p>If the woman had valued her meal, and clung selfishly unto it, she really would have eaten it and died; but when she chose to take a risk on God, through giving her last, heaven declared multiplication on her resources.</p>
		  	<p>Do not cling unto anything, so much that you will be unwilling to give it up when God tells you to. Only rely on God’s Word, and your life is insured. Be blessed!</p>
