		  	<h5><strong> LOVE: A New Commandment</strong></h5>


		  	<p><i>A new commandment I give unto you, That ye love one another; as I have loved you, that ye also love one another (John 13:34)</i></p>
		  	


		  	<blockquote>Loving without limit is the difference we exhibit as Sons of God... Your ability to love someone who is not directly connected to you is what differentiates you. </blockquote>

		  	<p>Ever wondered what exactly is meant by ‘A new commandment’? We have earlier been given the 10 commandments, through Moses. When a new commandment is spoken about, what is entailed is that it replaces the old.</p>
		  	<p>Previously, the commandments were, thou shall not kill, steal, covet, amongst others... Indeed, by loving, all these are covered. A true study of love, from 1 Corinthians 13, reveals that love encompasses all other attributes and commandments.</p>
		  	<p>If you really love, you will not want to kill, steal, or hurt anyone. If you’ve really got the love of the Father in you, your steps will be flawless.</p>
		  	<p>For a moment, I pondered on the parable of the rich man and Lazarus, and then I began to wonder, what really led the Rich man to hell. The bible never recorded that Lazarus asked the rich man for anything and the rich man refused. We are only made to understand that Lazarus desired the rich man’s crumbs...</p>
		  	<p>When I compared his acts to the 10 commandments, I really couldn’t presume him liable to condemnation, until I studied the commandment of love. Indeed, what led him to hell was the fact that he breached the commandment of love at some point.</p>
		  	<p>In essence, the rich man may have observed Lazarus, but waited patiently for him to ask, and he didn’t. That’s the same way we meet people who are in need on the street, we may only consider giving them a penny if they ask.</p>
		  	<p>I think the issue with the rich man, rested in the fact that Lazarus was not just any beggar on the street, but a neighbour to the rich man. He was resident in the rich man’s gate.</p>
		  	<p>We can conclude that the rich man was led to hell, not by his deliberate refusal to help a poor man, but by observing a poor neighbour in need, and acting indifferently and nonchalantly. That’s not love!</p>
		  	<p>If he had the love of God, even though he may not have been directly related to Lazarus, he would have inquired who the poor man was... He would have shown some love. How many times have we encountered people in dire need of what we possess excessively? Do you wait for them to ask? Love does the asking and enquires. Love opens your eyes to identify the needs of another. Love is sacrificial.</p>
		  	<p><i>For if ye love them which love you, what reward have ye? do not even the publicans the same?</i></p>
		  	<p><i>And if ye salute your brethren only, what do ye more than others? do not even the publicans so?</i></p>
		  	<p><i>Be ye therefore perfect, even as your Father which is in heaven is perfect. (Matthew 5:46-48)</i></p>
		  	<p>Love is what you have to prove that you are a Son of God. Loving without limit is the difference we exhibit as Sons of God. The rich man must have shown love to his relatives, it’s normal. Your ability to love someone who is not directly connected to you is what differentiates you.</p>
		  	<p>It is the new commandment... Love! Don’t breach this commandment like the rich man did. The bible attests to the greatness of this commandment. It says,</p>
		  	<p><i>Above all, love each other deeply, because love covers over a multitude of sins. (1 Peter 4:8) NIV</i></p>
		  	<p>Above all else, love... Love should be prioritized! All that rich man ever needed to transform him from his state of iniquity was an act of love... What you need to step into your destiny is love!</p>
		  	<p>Today, make a decision to love... Is there anyone whom you’ve observed to be in need of something you know you can give? Take a step to find out what your neighbor needs. Everyone has something to give... it may not necessarily be finances. Render support, counsel and prayers, in any measure you can. Love!</p>
