		  	<p><i>But ye are a chosen generation, a royal priesthood, an holy nation, a peculiar people; that ye should shew forth the praises of him who hath called you out of darkness into his marvellous light; (1 Peter 2:9)</i></p>


		  	<blockquote>Your real tenacity and strength is embedded in the discovery of who you really are.</blockquote>

		  	<p>You are not ordinary! Your real tenacity and strength is embedded in the discovery of who you really are. You might be a Prince, but as long as you don’t know it, a slave is better off than you.</p>
		  	<p>One thing propelled Joseph to his place of destiny; right from the time Joseph was in his father’s house, in the pit, serving Pharaoh, and even in the prison, he never lost consciousness of who he was. His great dreams made him to believe that he is not ordinary.</p>
		  	<p>Brethren, it takes a man rising up to the discovery of his unique identity, to get to his destiny. Men who think ordinary can never attain anything extra-ordinary.</p>
		  	<p>We are a chosen generation; the term ‘chosen’ entails that amongst a broad range of people, you have been singled out. Therefore brethren, we are not meant to follow the crowd, but lead them; we are not meant to conform to the world, but transform it. You are the Lord’s choice, live like it.</p>
		  	<p>We are a royal priesthood; Priests are there to hold up and edify others. They possess Divine authority; they are distinct from all others. They think differently, speak differently and act differently, with the understanding that they are not ordinary. We are not just a priesthood, but a royal one at that.</p>
		  	<p>We are a holy nation; holiness is our nature! Beloved, do not agree with the evil in the world; do not be corrupted by the things of the world. Every Son of God is a nation; the destinies of many are linked to you. We are made to influence the people within our reach, with the undiluted Word of God. Remain ever conscious of who you are — A holy nation!</p>
		  	<p>Furthermore brethren, we are a peculiar people. The whole world can be filled with great men, but your kind of greatness is special and unique. Even amongst the great, you remain outstanding. I always looked down on myself and my abilities, until I realized how peculiar I am. Verily, there cannot be a better you.</p>
		  	<p>Beloved, you are greater than you think you are. Never look down on yourself; never allow anyone to make you feel that you are not good enough; believe in your potentials! God has invested so much to make you peculiarly great.</p>
		  	<p>All that we have been made to be; all that we are, is done for us by God for this one reason—that we may show forth His praises—We have not always been great, not many of us were strong, not many of us were wise and not many of us were of noble calling, but God has called us out of darkness into His glorious light.</p>
		  	<p>Therefore, in all that we do, let God be praised. Declare God’s Word in all the earth . . . Let men be attracted to God, through your light that shines brighter by the days. Anything that conceals God’s praises, defies who you are. Be blessed!</p>
