		  	<p><i>And the decree went forth that the wise men should be slain; and they sought Daniel and his fellows to be slain. (Daniel 2:13)</i></p>
	

		  	<blockquote>For every proof of virtuousness, there must be a test of authenticity.</blockquote>

		  	<p>Daniel and his fellows—Shedrach, Meshach and Abednego—had proven by their standards that they did not need defilement to be approved, recognized and chosen.</p>
		  	<p>The king attested to the fact that they were ten times healthier, wiser and better than all the other men, who had feasted on the fats of the king for many days.</p>
		  	<p>However, what Daniel and his colleagues may not have known earlier is the fact that for every proof of virtuousness, there must be a test of authenticity. They succeeded in proving how wise they were, but shortly after that, came an instance to test the degree and extent of their wisdom.</p>
		  	<p>Notice, the Kings decree was for wise men only. Not everyone was subject to being slain, but the wise.</p>
		  	<p>Daniel and his fellows may not have been considered wise men before then, thus, they wouldn’t have been subject to this decree of the king. In essence, that recognition they got by their standard, came with a trying challenge.</p>
		  	<p>This was a task of having to narrate the dream of the King, and interpreting it afterwards. Not only was it a difficult task, but a risky one; in that, failing to accomplish it within a given time would have resulted in loss of lives.</p>
		  	<p>It is stated that Daniel had an understanding in visions and dreams (Daniel 1:17). Therefore, among the four of them, this task was specifically designed for Daniel; the Lord made the mystery of the King’s dream a revelation unto Daniel.</p>
		  	<p>Not long after Daniel’s authenticity was tested, there came also a test for Shedrach, Meshach and Abednego. Of this fellows, it is said that God gave them wisdom, knowledge and skill in all learning.</p>
		  	<p>They had been able to prove their worth, by setting a standard to remain undefiled by the Kings Meat or wine. However, their faith was tested by the heat of fiery furnace; will they compromise their stands and bow to idols, in order to save themselves from being burned?</p>
		  	<p>It was not enough to know that Daniel was a man of visions and dreams; it was not enough to know that Shedrach, Meshach and Abednego were men of wisdom, with great standards. There had to be a test for them all to prove their authenticity.</p>
		  	<p>Likewise beloved, for every promotion, there must be a test. Don’t be carried away by the fact that you have been recognized as being ten times better than others; don’t be carried away by the fact that your wisdom or gift has been recognized. There will be a risky test of Authenticity; prepare for it.</p>
		  	<p>If you have set a standard from the beginning, don’t compromise half way through your journey. Be blessed!</p>
