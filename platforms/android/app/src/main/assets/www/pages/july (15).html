		  	<p><i>When Jesus heard that, he said, This sickness is not unto death, but for the glory of God, that the Son of God might be glorified thereby.</i></p>
		  	<p><i>Now Jesus loved Martha, and her sister, and Lazarus.</i></p>
		  	<p><i>When he had heard therefore that he was sick, he abode two days still in the same place where he was. (John 11:4-6)</i></p>

		  	<blockquote>There are times when God does not prevent death, but one thing is certain. He will definitely not withhold resurrection and reestablishment. </blockquote>

		  	<p>When God Allows Death! The death of Lazarus gave light to the truth that sometimes, God deliberately allows death. Jesus may not have abode in the place which He was, for as much as two days, but when he heard that Lazarus was sick, he deliberately postponed the date of his departure.</p>
		  	<p>He intentionally decided to wait for the death of Lazarus!</p>
		  	<p>Jesus could have decided to heal Lazarus when he was sick, in order to prevent him from dying. However, Jesus tarried till his death, and resurrected him. This was for no other reason than to announce the pre-eminence of the power of resurrection over healing.</p>
		  	<p>Healing is divine, and so is Resurrection, but the latter is greater. The fact that something is dead does not mean that we’re done with that chapter yet. There’s still room for resurrection. Martha said,</p>
		  	<p><i>Then said Martha unto Jesus, Lord, if thou hadst been here, my brother had not died. (John 11:21)</i></p>
		  	<p>Martha attested to the truth that Jesus could have healed Lazarus if He arrived earlier; however, Jesus wrought this miracle to stir our faith, not to give up, even in death, for there could be resurrection.</p>
		  	<p>Jesus, in reply to Martha said,</p>
		  	<p><i>“Thy brother shall rise again ... I am the resurrection, and the life: he that believeth in me, though he were dead, yet shall he live:” (John 11:23 & 25)</i></p>
		  	<p>God might not have stopped Lazarus from dying, but He resurrected him. Beloved, God might not have prevented you from losing all your possessions, but there is a reestablishment.</p>
		  	<p>God did not prevent Job’s first family from dying. He didn’t prevent Job from losing his possessions. He didn’t prevent Job from losing his health. However, there was a mighty reestablishment. Job’s latter days were still greater than the former.</p>
		  	<p>Beloved, there are times when God does not prevent death, but one thing is certain. He will definitely not withhold resurrection and reestablishment. Encourage yourself in this truth — you lost what you had, in order to get something greater — Our latter will always be greater than the past. Be blessed!</p>
