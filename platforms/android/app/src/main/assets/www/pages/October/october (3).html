		  	<p><i>Let us therefore come boldly unto the throne of grace, that we may obtain mercy, and find grace to help in time of need. (Hebrews 4:16)</i></p>

		  	<blockquote>The throne of grace is spiritual, and can never be accessed from the physical realm.</blockquote>

		  	<p>Previously, we have studied about the wonderments of the Grace, Mercy and Favor of God. These three works wonders, beyond human comprehension.</p>
		  	<p>How is it that a man obtained promotion without asking or deserving it? Grace, Mercy and Favor! These three works together, to catapult a man from his present realm, to a higher place.</p>
		  	<p>It is not enough to understand the effect of God’s grace, mercy and favor in the life of a man, but to know how to obtain all these in a time of need.</p>
		  	<p>The throne of Grace is a bank that holds an overflowing account of Mercy, Grace and Favor, specifically for Sons of God. This account can be accessed anytime, and virtues can be withdrawn as many times as possible, but it never goes red. This is such an account with no withdrawal limits whatsoever.</p>
		  	<p>What do you need to open up such an account? Sonship! Except you are born-again, you can never gain access to the throne of Grace; thus, your life remains free from sweatless production, underserved promotion and unrequested earnings. In essence, for every little production, you must labor excessively hard.</p>
		  	<p>I believe that this is not what any man desires for himself; many define life as being a tough field, thus, they all want to cease from their struggles.</p>
		  	<p>Such a life can only be received when the Holy Spirit is received; thus, access is granted to the throne of Grace.</p>
		  	<p>Rejoice, for the throne of grace is now accessible without any hindrance. Do you seek an overflow of God’s abundant Grace, Mercy and Favor in your life? Go to the throne of grace and obtain.</p>
		  	<p>The use of the term obtain implies boldness; in essence, we are not going to the throne of grace to seek permission to borrow some grace and mercy, but we are going confidently to receive that, which has already been made available for us.</p>
		  	<p>It is erroneous for a born-again man, to lack Grace, Mercy and Favor. We don’t need to struggle, request permission (ask), or even deserve it to receive it.</p>
		  	<p>Are you in a time of need? You know where to go - the throne of grace! The throne of grace is spiritual, and can never be accessed from the physical realm. Walk yourself to that throne by constantly stirring up your spirit in meditation and prayers in the Holy Ghost. Be blessed!</p>
