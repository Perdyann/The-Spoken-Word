		  	<p><i>By this shall all men know that ye are my disciples, if ye have love one to another. (John 13:35)</i></p>
		  	

		  	<blockquote>Love is the unique identity borne by Sons of God. Do you want to know your stand in Christ? Measure the extent of your love! </blockquote>

		  	<p>Love is the identity we bear as Sons of God; it is by loving that we are proven to be Sons.</p>
		  	<p>I don’t respect people for their great profiles and reputation; their fluency in speech is not enough to earn my respect; I don’t respect anyone for the number of their congregation, popularity or fame. What I value in a man is love: that alone proves that He is a Son of God.</p>
		  	<p>You might have a great profile but not be commended by God; your fluency in speech might have impacted and inspired many, but you might still not be approved by God; you might be the most famous of all times, yet not serving God; but by loving, men shall know that you are a Son of God.</p>
		  	<p>It takes God to really love, because God is love. It takes love to do what Jesus did. He casted away His reputation, and laid His life for the world that didn’t even deserve it.</p>
		  	<p>Jesus did not just claim to be the Son of God; He proved it by the manner of love He showed. Likewise beloved, we are not the Sons of God because we have said so, or tried to convince everyone that we are. We are not the Sons of God because we go to church every Sunday. We are sons because we love!</p>
		  	<p>Love is the unique identity borne by Sons of God. The moment we received the Holy Ghost, we received love. It is written:</p>
		  	<p><i>And hope maketh not ashamed; because the love of God is shed abroad in our hearts by the Holy Ghost which is given unto us. (Romans 5:5)</i></p>
		  	<p>The love of God is shed abroad in our hearts by the Holy Ghost; anyone that has not love has not the Holy Ghost.</p>
		  	<p>It is impossible to be in Christ and not love; do you want to know your stand in Christ? Measure the extent of your love! That’s how the world knows that we are His — Love!</p>
		  	<p>It is easy to say, “I love you”, but sometimes difficult to prove it. It takes God to actually love, because God is love. Verily, someone, who does not know God, cannot really love you, even though he claims to.</p>
		  	<p>To what extent do you love your neighbors? As yourself? If you don’t love them as you love yourself, then you are not operating in God’s kind of Love!</p>
		  	<p>How concerned are you about the needs of those around you? Love is not selfish! If Jesus thought about himself alone, or if He did not love us as He loved himself, He wouldn’t have made such a sacrifice.</p>
		  	<p>Love is our unique identity as Sons of God. It will be easy for God to say, “I know you not” on the last day, to people who have merely built their profile and reputation at the expense of love.</p>
		  	<p>Henceforth, understand that you are identified by love, and without love, you have no recognition, identity or place in God. Be blessed!</p>
