		  	<p><i>And these signs shall follow them that believe; In my name shall they cast out devils; they shall speak with new tongues;</i></p>
		  	<p><i>They shall take up serpents; and if they drink any deadly thing, it shall not hurt them; they shall lay hands on the sick, and they shall recover. (Mark 16:17-18)</i></p>

		  	<blockquote>You might have cried to God for too long, but when will you have faith? Signs respond to faith and not tears! </blockquote>

		  	<p>So many miraculous signs are spelt out in this scripture, and for a moment I wondered, who is qualified for these signs? Them that believe! A believer is born for exploits and nothing less.</p>
		  	<p>Notice, the scripture says them that believe. In essence, believing is the key criteria to walking in the miraculous. Signs are not reserved for Pastors, Prophets, Apostles, Teachers or Evangelists. The mistake, which so many Christians have made, is embracing the thought that only Pastors can perform miraculous signs such as healing, casting out demons, amongst others.</p>
		  	<p>As a result of this, even when they pray for a sick person, they don’t actually believe that the person will get healed; thus, they redirect the person to their pastors. That lack of believe is what limits them and nothing else.</p>
		  	<p>You hear such people say, “O, you’ve got cancer? Let us just pray for the pains to subside, and we will go see my Pastor over the weekend.” But that’s not what the scripture says; it says that when we lay hands on the sick, they shall recover. Why then do we intentionally pray for the pains to subside, and not be gone? When I pondered on this for a while, I realized the issue—a lot of believers really don’t believe.</p>
		  	<p>You are a believer because you believe in Christ, and have given your life to him; but how can you believe in Christ without believing in His Word? If He says that you are born for exploits, then that is what it is; you have no reason to fear—only believe!</p>
		  	<p>Exploits are our divine heritage; we don’t need to fast and pray on the mountains to be able to function in these miraculous signs. Why follow after signs that were made to follow you?</p>
		  	<p>These signs are not born by our tears in prayers, but by the faith in our heart. You might have cried to God for too long, but when will you have faith? Signs respond to faith and not tears!</p>
		  	<p>We shall cast out demons in His name; we shall speak in new tongues; serpents, venom and poison are not capable of harming us; the sick shall recover when we lay hands on them. Yes! This is our nature.</p>
		  	<p>There is nothing that hurts me as much as seeing believers perish; these are the very people, to whom these signs are given. If only they knew how much exploits they were born for, they wouldn’t dare harbor fear for another second.</p>
		  	<p>Beloved, these signs are not restricted to those in Spiritual offices, but it’s a heritage to all that believe. Believing is the key criteria and nothing else. You might call yourself a believer, but do you really believe? Be blessed!</p>
