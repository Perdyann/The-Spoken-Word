		  	<p><i>For as the rain cometh down, and the snow from heaven, and returneth not thither, but watereth the earth, and maketh it bring forth and bud, that it may give seed to the sower, and bread to the eater: So shall my word be that goeth forth out of my mouth: </i></p>
		  	<p><i>it shall not return unto me void, but it shall accomplish that which I please, and it shall prosper in the thing whereto I sent it. (Isaiah 55:10-11)</i></p>

		  	<blockquote>Every Word of God has a purpose to serve, and until it is accomplished, it cannot fail or be revoked. </blockquote>

		  	<p>The Word of God does not return to Him void; has He said it? If yes, then its manifestation is certain, no matter how long it tarries.</p>
		  	<p>The Word of God is compared to the rain and snow, we have seen the rain, and we have probably seen the snow. One thing we will certainly attest to is the fact that it neither rains nor snows upward but downward. In essence, the rain and snow does not return to the sky, rather, they shower heavily upon the earth.</p>
		  	<p>In the same way beloved, the direction of God’s Word is not upward but downward. It is showered down on the earth for a purpose, and it does not return to God void.</p>
		  	<p>I’m here with a single message today—God’s Word can never be revoked, withdrawn or made void. That, which He has spoken over your life will surely be accomplished.</p>
		  	<p>Why do you think that the Centurion didn’t bother persuading Jesus to come down to his house? He only insisted that Jesus spoke a Word, and his servant would be healed. Verily, he understood that there was something about the Word of God.</p>
		  	<p>It is written: He sent his word, and healed them, and delivered them from their destructions (Psalm 107:20). The Lord sent His Word and something happened—they were delivered from all their destructions. Every Word of God has a purpose to serve, and until it is accomplished, it cannot fail or be revoked.</p>
		  	<p>When God said, “let there be light”, there was light. That Word of His fulfilled a great purpose, as it ruled over darkness. In the same way, God’s Word is effective and purposeful. As He spoke, His Word did not return to Him void, rather, it manifested a purpose.</p>
		  	<p>God’s Word cannot be withdrawn or revoked. Why should you harbor the fear of failure, when God’s Word proves that you are a success? Why should you harbor the fear of sickness and infirmity, when God’s Word reveals Divine health?</p>
		  	<p>If there’s one thing constant about God’s Word, it is irrevocability. Even if heaven and earth passes away, His Word will still remain irrevocable. There is no better place to lean on or trust, but the Word of God.</p>
		  	<p>Men have acted contrary to their words and promises, the system of the world has failed many, but God’s Word remains stable, irrevocable and productive; it can never return void. Be blessed!</p>
