		  	<p><i>Enter ye in at the strait gate: for wide is the gate, and broad is the way, that leadeth to destruction, and many there be which go in thereat:</i></p>
		  	<p><i>Because strait is the gate, and narrow is the way, which leadeth unto life, and few there be that find it. (Matthew 7:13-14)</i></p>

		  	<blockquote>The road that leads to death is wide, broad and has many people in it; however, the road that leads to life is straight, narrow and lonely. These are the characteristics of each.</blockquote>

		  	<h4><b>DEATH</b></h4>

		  	<p>The road to death is broad and wide. In essence, it presents men with a range of wild choices. There are so many attractive things that could freely be done. It gives men total freedom of speech, hence, they can say anything they like; using swear words are not prohibited in this road. People can dress however they desire; nudity is a virtue in this road. People can use their bodies in any way they desire; sexual immorality is highly esteemed in this road.</p>
		  	<p>Due to the liberty this road gives to all kinds of evil, it is highly populated.—Many there be which go in thereat. The road seems so much like the best and most appropriate, because everyone else is on that road. People often say, “Have fun like every other youth is doing”</p>
		  	<p>Beloved it’s high time we realise that what every other person is doing is not necessarily the right thing. After all, the road to destruction is very populated, while the road to life is lonely.</p>

		  	<h4><b>LIFE</b></h4>

		  	<p>The road to life is strait and narrow. In essence, there is a restriction, lifestyle, manner of speech and charisma that suits this path. People on this path do not talk anyhow.</p>
		  	<p>People on this road, are guided only by the Word of God, and the Holy Spirit. They don’t act anyhow. There is an understanding they have about the vision and purpose of their lives, which limits and restricts them. The understanding that your body is the temple of God will keep you from defiling it.</p>
		  	<p>People on this road are careful not to be led by their senses or self-will, but by revelation. This road is characterised by righteousness, peace, joy, holiness, love, amongst others. It requires an extent of sacrifice, which not everyone is willing to pay. I am not surprised that it is described as narrow and lonely.</p>
		  	<p>If you are treading on the route to life, expect to be lonely. People are easily attracted to the wild and broad way. They want to be acquainted with comfort in life. Indeed, more than we should desire the pleasures of life, which makes it comfortable, we should prioritize our purpose on earth.</p>
		  	<p>What road are you on? Are you willing to give up and sacrifice the pleasures of this world, and walk in life? Are you willing to give up your company, and walk in the lonely road of life? Do you want to be comfortable or you want your destiny?</p>
		  	<p>At the end of it all, our destiny matters most. The journey is temporal but the destination is everlasting; choose the everlasting gain. Do you want the temporal pleasures of the wide, broad and smooth journey, or do you want the destination of the narrow road—Life? It’s a choice... Don’t go for temporal comfort, choose eternal comfort!</p>
		  	<p>It is a lonely road, not many have found it. But as privileged as you are to be reading this piece today, I admonish you to spare a moment, and think about where you will spend eternity.</p>
		  	<p>Your friends might call you old-school, your family might not be willing to travel on this path with you... it’s indeed a lonely road, but it really won’t last forever, before we embrace eternal life. Choose ye the route to take this day; Life or Death? Be blessed!</p>
