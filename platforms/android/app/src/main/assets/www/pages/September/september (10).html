		  	<p><i>Not now as a servant, but above a servant, a brother beloved, specially to me, but how much more unto thee, both in the flesh, and in the Lord? (Philemon 1:16)</i></p>

		  	<blockquote>The level of a servant is meant for people without a mediator; when a mediator gets involved, the level of brotherhood is embraced. </blockquote>

		  	<p>Paul, in his letter to Philemon, pleaded with him to receive Onesimus, who was once his servant, but departed for a season.</p>
		  	<p>It is amazing to comprehend the fact that Paul and Timothy were not just requesting that Philemon accepts Onesimus back as a servant, but demanding that he receives him to a higher place—as a brother.</p>
		  	<p>Before he departed, he was only but a servant; upon his return, he is to be received to the place of a beloved brother. That’s the effect of having a great mediator.</p>
		  	<p>Paul and Timothy were mediators between Philemon and his servant, Onesimus. It was through their plea that the latter was received to a higher place.</p>
		  	<p>We operate from a Higher Realm, not because we deserve it, but because we have a mediator. With Jesus Christ, we can only get higher and better; just like the case of Onesimus, who was promoted from being a mere servant to the place of brotherhood, we also can only be catapulted to great heights in Jesus.</p>
		  	<p>It is time for servants to be made brothers, masses to be made leaders, the poor to be made rich, and slaves to be made free men; however, this cannot be easily achieved without a mediator.</p>
		  	<p>When you receive Jesus into your life, things can never remain the same. If Onesimus, who simply had Paul, could be promoted to a higher place, then we have no reason not to be promoted, having Christ as our mediator.</p>
		  	<p>It is an error for a man, who has accepted Christ to remain at the same level he was yesterday. The level of a <i>servant</i> is meant for people without a mediator; when a mediator gets involved, the level of <i>brotherhood</i> is embraced.</p>
		  	<p>I feel it so heavy within me to declare this to someone today — Get ready to be received to a Higher Place!</p>
		  	<p>Don’t be satisfied being a servant, aspire to become a brother, and even more. Jesus did not call his disciples servant, but friends.</p>
		  	<p>Servants are ignorant of inner details, but friends and family are knowledgeable of everything. You are not merely a servant of God, but a Son of God!</p>
		  	<p>That position, which you were denied yesterday, cannot just be given to you as it was. You will receive something higher than that, as you go through our one and only mediator, Jesus Christ. Be blessed!</p>
