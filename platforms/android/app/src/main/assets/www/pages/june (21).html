		  	<p><i>For we are God’s masterpiece. He has created us anew in Christ Jesus, so we can do the good things he planned for us long ago. (Ephesians 2:10 NLT)</i></p>
		 
		  	<blockquote>Having the seed of greatness in you is not enough to make you really great.  Not every seed that is planted eventually germinates and becomes a tree.</blockquote>

		  	<p>We are the handiwork of God, created uniquely, to suit a special purpose. Everything created by God was made to be great; God does not create ordinary things.</p>
		  	<p>However, not everyone is living out that great life sketched out by God. Greatness is an inbuilt seed, which is carefully nurtured until the time of its expression and manifestation.</p>
		  	<p>Having the seed of greatness in you is not enough to make you really great. Not every seed that is planted eventually germinates and becomes a tree. In order for a seed to germinate, sprout forth, and be fruitful, it has to be well nurtured. So many people worry over irrelevant issues in life; what we should be more concerned about is how well our seeds are nurtured.</p>
		  	<p>To start with, you need to have the knowledge that you have got a seed of greatness in you. If you don’t know what you’ve got, you cannot appreciate it. Having a seed planted in your garden, without knowing about it, will make you unconcerned about its nutrition. You will not care about how adequately it receives water daily or is exposed to sunlight. Thus, the seed might die and never sprout forth.</p>
		  	<p>Many people don’t regard themselves as though they’ve got any worth. You can never maximize your potentials until you discover them. You can never really be great until you realize greatness in you. Do not undervalue yourself! It is written:</p>
		  	<p><i>Verily, verily, I say unto you, Except a corn of wheat fall into the ground and die, it abideth alone: but if it die, it bringeth forth much fruit. (John 12:24)</i></p>
		  	<p>Every seed needs to be planted before it sprouts out. When it is planted, it dies in the ground, and through its death, it brings forth much fruit. Likewise, except you die to self, you cannot live up to your calling. Little wonder Galatians 5:24 quotes, <i> “And they that are Christ’s have crucified the flesh with the affections and lusts.”</i></p>
		  	<p>Furthermore, for a planted seed to sprout, it needs to be exposed to air, water and sunlight. Likewise, for the seed of greatness within you to be fully expressed, you need to be exposed to God’s Word, and constantly receive deep revelations from within.</p>
		  	<p>Beloved, we are pregnant with great visions, divine dreams and aspirations. The last thing those visions need is starvation; a vision that is starved will eventually die. Verily brethren, when you’ve got a vision, feed it with the right information, speak positively about it, and guard it!</p>
		  	<p>Pests are the worst enemies of our seeds, if you are not careful, they will creep into your garden, and eventually eat up every valuable thing therein. You need apply the right pesticides, to tackle pests. Likewise, we have seeds of greatness within us; we are pregnant with great visions. But there are destiny fighters and killers all around.</p>
		  	<p>There are people, whose only mission in your life is to kill your vision. Not to worry; when you’ve got the right pesticide, you will know exactly how to handle such personalities.</p>
		  	<p>When you pray constantly in the Holy Ghost, and declare positive words over your vision; nothing can stop you!</p>
		  	<p>Finally brethren, we must never lose consciousness of our greatness. Our greatness is of God; we are born with an uncommon deposit. Having such deposit within us, we must ensure that we receive the right information from God’s Word, and we are spiritually minded always. Never cease to pray in the Holy Ghost. Be blessed!</p>
