		  	<p><i>Jesus saith unto him, I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me. (John 14:6)</i></p>
		


		  	<blockquote>No matter what our experiences on earth are, we all must approach a certain juncture where only the Way, the Truth and Life can see us through.</blockquote>

		  	<p>The use of the term ‘the’ before each quality of Jesus cannot be ignored or replaced, as it reveals deeper meaning of all qualities.</p>
		  	<p>He is The Way; The Truth and The Life. If it was said, “I am a way, a truth and a life”, we will obviously assume that there are many other ways, truths and lives. However, using the term ‘the’ insinuates that there is no other Way, there is no other Truth, and there is no other Life outside of Jesus. Indeed, He is the only Way, Truth and Life.</p>
		  	<p>He is not a Way amongst many other ways, He is the Way. It is not possible for anyone to get to his destiny in life, except he follows the right route, direction and way—Jesus. There is a way to get to your purpose; there is a way to fulfillment; there is a way to success; Jesus is that way!</p>
		  	<p>He is not a Truth amongst many other truths, He is the Truth. Therefore, the word ‘truth’ does not exist outside Jesus. The report the Doctors give to you about your health every month end is not the truth, but merely a fact.</p>
		  	<p>Truth transcends facts. Facts are natural, economical, medical, physical and chemical realities, but the truth is God’s Word. On many occasions, the truth has defied and defeated facts.</p>
		  	<p>When Jesus walked on water, truth defied natural facts!</p>
		  	<p>When Jesus broke 5 loaves and 2 fish amongst a multitude of over 5000 people, and collected a remnant of 12 baskets, truth defied economic facts!</p>
		  	<p>When Jesus picked up an ear that was cut-off, and fixed it back to function properly without any form of surgery, truth defied medical facts!</p>
		  	<p>When Jesus, in His human body, ascended into heaven, truth defied all facts on gravitational laws of physics.</p>
		  	<p>When Jesus turned water into wine, truth defied chemical facts!</p>
		  	<p>Time and space will not permit me to mention all instances. Verily, in all occasion I’ve ever encountered or experienced, truth defied facts. The life of one man (Jesus—The truth), recorded enough victory of Truth over facts; and He gave us the grace to live above facts.</p>
		  	<p>Beloved, should we then rely on mere facts, when there is a greater truth? Stop wailing over the Doctors report, when God’s Word declares Divine health on His children.</p>
		  	<p>Not only is Jesus the Way and the Truth, He is the Life! He is not a life amongst many others; He is the only Life. I often say to people, “Outside Jesus, there is no life.”</p>
		  	<p>Men who walk on the surface of the earth, but have not yet encountered Jesus, are merely existing, not living. Life is found in Christ alone.</p>
		  	<p>I once walked in the pleasures of the world, glorifying my flesh, thinking I was living the real life of fun, but when I encountered the Life—Jesus, I felt on cloud nine; I realized how much I had wasted in mere existence.</p>
		  	<p>Beloved, it is never too late to live an abundant life in Christ; God has a way of reestablishing our wasted years. Give your life to Christ today; it is never too late to start living.</p>
		  	<p>No matter what our experiences on earth are, we all must approach a certain juncture where only the Way, the Truth and Life can see us through. No matter how great and attractive your destiny may be, you need to know the way to get there; you need to understand the truth about it; you need to live to access it.</p>
		  	<p>If Joseph did not understand these concepts, he never would have accessed destiny, as he may have been stranded in the pit or prison.</p>
		  	<p>All you need is the Holy Spirit. In Him, our life is insured. Be blessed!</p>
