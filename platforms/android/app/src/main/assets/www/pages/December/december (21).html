		  	<p><i>Some trust in and boast of chariots and some of horses, but we will trust in and boast of the name of the Lord our God.</i></p>
		  	<p><i>They are bowed down and fallen, but we are risen and stand upright. (Psalm 20:7-8)</i></p>
		  	

		  	<blockquote>Trusting God is relying on His Word as your guide, His name as your mantle, His ability as your strength, and His time to fulfil His plans for your life. </blockquote>

		  	<p>The name in which you trust is what determines your stand; great men are those whose trust is secured in the hands of the Lord. These fellows can never stumble or fall.</p>
		  	<p>It is amazing the places people deposit their trust. In horses and chariots? When David was to battle against Goliath, he had no horse or chariot to trust in; he had no weapon of war to trust in. He simply came against Goliath in the name of the Lord. When Goliath stumbled and fell, David was raised, and stood upright.</p>
		  	<p>The question is not how strong your stamina is, but how reliable the holder of your trust is. In whom do you trust?</p>
		  	<p>In Proverbs 3:6, we are acknowledged to trust in the Lord with all our hearts. What does it mean to trust in the Lord with all your heart? It is impossible to claim that you trust God without trusting in His Word; it is impossible to claim that you trust God without trusting in His Ability; it is impossible to claim that you trust God without trusting in His Timing; it is impossible to claim that you trust God without trusting in His Name.</p>
		  	<p>Trusting God is relying on His Word as your guide, His name as your mantle, His ability as your strength, and His perfect time to fulfil His plans for your life.</p>
		  	<p>A brother once told me that his bills outweighed his salary, so he was unable to pay his tithes. This was someone who was fully aware of God’s Word concerning tithing in Malachi. Yet the pressures of life weighed him down so much that he lost his trust in God’s Word.</p>
		  	<p>God said we should test Him in our tithes, and He will prove Himself by opening the windows of heaven, and emptying the blessings of heaven into our lives. Do you trust that Word enough to obey it?</p>
		  	<p>The only victory David had over Goliath was his faith and trust in God’s name. That’s the name that subdues every knee and elemental spirits of the world.</p>
		  	<p>In Philippians 4:13, it is proven how well we can do all things through the ability of Christ at work in us. Our strength is therefore not measured by the size of our muscles, but the ability of God. Do you believe that God is able to do much more than you can ask or think? Trust His ability!</p>
		  	<p>Finally brethren, we cannot trust His Name, Word and Ability without duly trusting His time. One thing I have learnt — never rush God’s timing.</p>
		  	<p>In Jeremiah 29:11, God assured us that He has great plans for our lives to give us a future and a hope. There is a time for the manifestation of every single plan of God for our lives.</p>
		  	<p>There is a time for everything. What you think you need now, might not be what God wants you to have in this season. Trusting God entails submitting to His plans and time. If He said it, it will surely be manifested; though it tarries, it will surely come to pass.</p>
		  	<p>The only guarantee you have of standing even when others are falling down, is your trust in God. When the world says there is a casting down, you shall say that there is a lifting up, because great is He, in whom you trust. Be blessed!</p>
