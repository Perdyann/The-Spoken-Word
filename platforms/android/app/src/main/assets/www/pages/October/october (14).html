		  	<p><i>They that were foolish took their lamps, and took no oil with them:</i></p>
		  	<p><i>But the wise took oil in their vessels with their lamps.</i></p>
		  	<p><i>And the foolish said unto the wise, Give us of your oil; for our lamps are gone out. (Matthew 25:3-4&8)</i></p>
		  

		  	<blockquote>More than you celebrate that great position, office and call, be sure to preserve your oil; because that’s what keeps the light on. </blockquote>

		  	<p>Oil is what keeps the lamp shining; a lamp cannot be useful without oil. In essence, the glory of a lamp is in its oil.</p>
		  	<p>Isn’t it foolish that five, out of the ten virgins were not wise enough to take oil with their lamps? Their virginity might have led them to the courts, but they needed oil to preserve them in that place.</p>
		  	<p>Verily, your gifts will lift you to a certain height, but it is not enough to sustain you in that height. Your oil needs to keep running over, for your light to keep shining brighter.</p>
		  	<p>Preserve your oil! Your oil is your usefulness, savor and substance; without it, your light will easily be put off.</p>
		  	<p>All the virgins probably felt satisfied when they entered into the court to wait for the bridegroom, but what five of them failed to realize was that oil was required to preserve them in that place. Verily, the joy is not in attaining any office or position, but in being sustained in that realm.</p>
		  	<p>The foolish virgins were driven out of the court by lack of oil, and when they returned, the door of the court was shut already. Lack of oil is lack of usefulness; when your oil cease to flow, your light is put off, and you are easily driven out of your position.</p>
		  	<p>More than you celebrate that great position, office and call, be sure to preserve your oil; because that’s what keeps the light on.</p>
		  	<p>There is an anointing on our lives; there is an oil that speaks for us; but that oil must be preserved. We understand from Hebrews 1:9 that God is He, who anoints us; and we also understand that iniquity contaminates the oil. Again it is written:</p>
		  	<p><i>As dead flies cause even a bottle of perfume to stink, so a little foolishness spoils great wisdom and honor. (Ecclesiastes 10:1)</i></p>
		  	<p>This goes a long way to prove that dead flies cause oil to stink, in the same way, a little folly contaminates he that is in reputation for wisdom and honor.</p>
		  	<p>Virgins are known for their reputation for wisdom and honor; but a little folly of not having enough oil, resulted in contamination and loss. Oil that is not preserved and harbors dead flies, will in no time release a stinking savor.</p>
		  	<p>That same oil that attracted people to you will also drive them away by its stinking savor, if it is not well preserved.</p>
		  	<p>How then is the oil preserved? We must acknowledge that God is He, who anoints us. He is the source of our oil. Thus, in life we can get disconnected from a lot of things, but never lose connection with God — the source!</p>
		  	<p>As long as you remain in connection and agreement with God, that oil is bound to flow without ceasing.</p>
		  	<p>Furthermore, we must understand that the dead flies, which perch into oil, and cause it to stink represents iniquity, folly, malice, arrogance, amongst others. When you are born-again, you should be dead to all these things. If you still live in them, they’d sap out your substance, savor and value.</p>
		  	<p>If the oil is gone, your substance, usefulness and value is gone; preserve your oil. Be blessed!</p>
