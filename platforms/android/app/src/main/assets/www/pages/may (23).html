		  	<p><i>And to the angel of the church in Philadelphia write; These things saith he that is holy, he that is true, he that hath the key of David, he that openeth, and no man shutteth; and shutteth, and no man openeth; (Revelation 3:7)</i></p>


		  	<blockquote>When you understand that God has the master key to every door in life, you will cease to fret about the situation of the doors before you.</blockquote>

		  	<p>Sometimes, we struggle too much in trying to get doors open or perhaps closed; the reason is because we might not have grasped the understanding and knowledge of He, who has the key to those doors.</p>
		  	<p>When you understand that God has the master key to every door in life, you will cease to fret about the situation of the doors before you. God solely has control over every situation we encounter in life. He had our lives all figured out, even before we were created.</p>
		  	<p>We must understand that God is the only one that has the ability to open or close doors. Therefore, in all situations, we must give Him thanks!</p>
		  	<p>Sometimes, it is easier to find ourselves thanking God for open doors, than closed ones. We often feel disappointed when doors are closed; however, we must learn to thank God for closed doors, just as much as we are grateful for open ones.</p>
		  	<p>There are doors that serve as gateways to disaster; there are prayers we make, that are more harmful than beneficial. God in His infinite mercies will always be quick to close such doors, and turn down such prayer requests.</p>
		  	<p>God’s Word gives us an assurance that we will receive whatsoever we ask for in Jesus name. However, for this to be effective, we have to ask rightly. Therefore, no matter how much you ask God to open a certain door for you, if it is amiss, He will rather keep it closed.</p>
		  	<p>There are things I desperately wanted, and earnestly prayed for in the past, but now, I am more grateful that I never received any of those. Now I know that they would have done more harm to me, than good.</p>
		  	<p>Back in the days, when I was so desperate for these, I never wanted to hear anything else; I never wanted to come to terms with anything contrary to my request. Obviously, my knowledge then was limited, but God saw ahead of me.</p>
		  	<p>We know in part; our knowledge might be quite limited; but God knows in full. He declares the end from the beginning... (Isaiah 46:10) If He opens a door, it’s for your good; If He shuts a door, it is still for your good. In everything, give God thanks.</p>
		  	<p>Furthermore, as it is stated above, When God opens a door, no one can shut it. Therefore, if any door is shut, God never opened it for you; because if He did, it will remain open.</p>
		  	<p>It is okay to push your way through open doors, but stop trying to push open, shut doors. Rather, thank God for shutting them. When people walk away from your life, stop trying by all means to get them back in; God knows why He allowed them out. Rather than getting discouraged over a lost contract, thank God for shutting that door.</p>
		  	<p>It is important to note that God is the one who has the key and not the devil. Therefore, the devil has no power or ability whatsoever, to open up, or shut doors. In essence, when a door is open, God opened it; and when it is shut, God shut it. The enemy cannot undo what God has done.</p>
		  	<p>When God has opened up doors of blessings to us, there is nothing the enemy can ever do to shut it. Likewise, when God has closed doors of shame and reproach, there is nothing the enemy can ever do to open it; he hasn’t got the keys.</p>
		  	<p>All we need to do is to submit to God’s ideal plan for our lives. Never insist on having things done your own way . . . Be blessed!</p>
