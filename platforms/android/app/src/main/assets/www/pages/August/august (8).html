		  	<p><i>And immediately there fell from his eyes as it had been scales: and he received sight forthwith, and arose, and was baptized. (Acts 9:18)</i></p>


		  	<blockquote>A destination has to be sighted and visualized before it can be attained. When the vision is not clear, the destiny cannot be certain.</blockquote>

		  	<p>After the conversion of Saul, after he had been without sight for three days, and God sent Ananias to lay hands on him, scales fell off his eyes.</p>
		  	<p>For a moment, I wondered what the significance of the scales from Saul’s eyes was. Why was it important for the scales to be shed off, before his sight could be restored?</p>
		  	<p>For you to be able to operate in the realm of purpose, you have to see with a clear eye. Purpose can never be fulfilled by a man, whose spiritual vision is impaired. A destination has to be sighted and visualized before it can be attained. When the vision is not clear, the destiny cannot be certain.</p>
		  	<p>Saul had wasted many years of his life, living outside purpose, simply because there were scales that prevented him from seeing greater things. As long as he couldn’t see great, he could never live great.</p>
		  	<p>The evolution began when the scales fell off; as soon as the scales fell off his eyes, he started preaching the same gospel of Jesus Christ, which he previously fought against.</p>
		  	<p>Isn’t it obvious that the reason why some people act the way they do is because the scales are still impairing their vision. A purposeful life begins when the scales are shed off.</p>
		  	<p>Saul couldn’t move into a new season of his life with the same scales of the old season. Likewise beloved, you cannot expect to step into your next level of glory, without shedding off the scales, mindset, and issues of the past.</p>
		  	<p>Just like the scales; there might be factors in life that have hindered you from seeing clearly. God wants to take you to your next level of glory, but as long as you cling on to these things, you cannot move forward.</p>
		  	<p>These scales could be your companion, mindset, relationships or habits. Until you shed off some scales, break up some relationships, quit some habits, and give up some mindsets, you cannot live up to your calling.</p>
		  	<p>The scales on reptiles are like waterproof; that is, the scale of a reptile makes it impenetrable and impervious. In this sense, it is quite unreceptive to anything in its immediate environment.</p>
		  	<p>Because Saul’s eyes were covered by scales, he couldn’t see anything. No matter how much preaching he heard, and how much of the bible he read, his spirit remained unreceptive. The scales served as a hindrance to him absorbing anything good; the moment the scales fell off, he became a new person.</p>
		  	<p>Beloved, Saul’s life only began to have a meaning after the scales had been shed off. Likewise, our greatness in life begins when the scales of old fall off. Are you willing to give up the scales for the revelations ahead? Be blessed!</p>
