		  	<p><i>And I, if and when I am lifted up from the earth [on the cross], will draw and attract all men [Gentiles as well as Jews] to Myself. (John 12:32 AMP)</i></p>

		  	<blockquote>We are not made to conform to the system of the world, but to transform it.</blockquote>

		  	<p>Previously, I always made reference to this scripture, in admonishing people to the Lift the Lord up; assuring them that He will draw them up as well. However, when I meditated deeper on the lines of this scripture, I realized one truth: He has already been lifted up!</p>
		  	<p>When Jesus made this sentence, He was referring to His death and resurrection; He was saying that after He has conquered the cross and death, He will draw all men to His realm of Life. There is therefore no point admonishing people to lift Him up; He has been lifted up already.</p>
		  	<p>There is a promise that is spelled out in this scripture; Jesus left a Word — after He is exalted, He will draw and attract all men to Himself.</p>
		  	<p>Beloved, let me spare a moment to announce to you that the moment you received Christ, you were drawn to His Realm of Life. The dwelling place of a born-again man is not the earth, even though he is physically present here.</p>
		  	<p>A born again man has been translated by his new-birth to the kingdom of God; thus, he operates on earth according to his spiritual position.</p>
		  	<p>Jesus did not just promise to draw all men up; He promised to draw all men to Himself. He has drawn us to exactly the same place as He is; in essence we are now where God is!</p>
		  	<p>We dwell in the same realm as God; although we are physically present on the earth, we live not by the system, rules and principles of the earth . . . We play by a different set of rules.</p>
		  	<p>We no longer speak the language of the world, but a Higher Language. It is written:</p>
		  	<p><i>And the inhabitant shall not say, I am sick: the people that dwell therein shall be forgiven their iniquity. (Isaiah 33:24)</i></p>
		  	<p>The inhabitants of which realm? God’s realm of Life! Probably, before we were drawn to the Higher Realm, it seemed alright for us to say, “I am sick”, but now, as we are exalted to the realm where God dwells, we have embraced a new language. We don’t get sick anymore, so we can’t say it. Our words are now so powerful that whatsoever we say is established; when we speak Divine health, it is established!</p>
		  	<p>Since we have been drawn to God’s Realm of Life, what are we still doing on the earth? Beloved, we are representing the interests of Zion. Just like an ambassador of the UK to US does not conform to the system of the US, but represents the interest on His own nation in the land, so also, we are not made to conform to the system of the world, but to transform it.</p>
		  	<p>It is highly erroneous for a man, who is in Christ, to conform to the system of the world. Beloved, we have been drawn to a Higher Place; let us live the Higher Life. Be blessed!</p>
