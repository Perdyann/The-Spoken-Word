		  	<p><i>But as it is written, Eye hath not seen, nor ear heard, neither have entered into the heart of man, the things which God hath prepared for them that love him.</i></p>
		  	<p><i>But God hath revealed them unto us by his Spirit: for the Spirit searcheth all things, yea, the deep things of God. (1 Corinthians 2:9-10)</i></p>
	

		  	<blockquote>Until you get to discover the truth, you will remain deprived of its advantages.</blockquote>

		  	<p>So often, people tend to lay more emphasis on the first part of this scripture, than the second. In some cases, people don’t even bother reading the next verse.</p>
		  	<p>Thus, we hear a lot of people say that no one knows or understands the plans of God, he works in mysterious ways, no one has heard of what God has prepared for us, amongst others.</p>
		  	<p>I guess if these fellows had spared a moment to read the next verse, there wouldn’t have been any misconception. If you want to get an in-depth understanding of any scripture, study the entire book. Don’t just hold on to a verse; there might be additional details before or after it.</p>
		  	<p>The next verse is a continuation of the first; just after it is said that no eye has seen what God has prepared, it continues, but God hath revealed.</p>
		  	<p>In essence, no one has actually perceived what God has prepared with his natural senses; but through the spirit of God, we have received a revelation of everything.</p>
		  	<p>It is okay when carnal men speak of the ways of God as being so mysterious, but to a spiritual man, the Spirit reveals the deep things of God. From the moment a man discovers what God has prepared for Him, he begins to operate freely in them.</p>
		  	<p>Another misconception about this scripture is the thought that whatsoever God must have prepared is only accessible when we get to heaven. Quite alright, God has prepared great things for us in heaven, but has also prepared things for us on the earth as well.</p>
		  	<p>This scripture is not limited to heaven, but the earth as well. When a man becomes born-again, he is translated by that birth to a Higher Realm; he begins to gain access to hidden treasures.</p>
		  	<p>There are rights and privileges we receive when we receive Christ. Until you get to know about all these, you cannot live in them. We are above sickness; there is power in our tongue; we reign in all authority; we are above poverty and failure. Yes! God has prepared this for they that love Him. Until you get to discover the truth, you will remain deprived of its advantages.</p>
		  	<p>Don’t keep languishing in ignorance, waiting for what God has prepared in heaven. He has prepared so much for us in the earth, and in heaven.</p>
		  	<p>When you get an understanding of this, you begin to live the Higher Life. Things that we could never perceive with our natural senses are revealed to us by the Spirit of God. Rejoice! Be blessed!</p>
