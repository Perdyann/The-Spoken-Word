		  	<p><i>That he told her all his heart, and said unto her, There hath not come a razor upon mine head; for I have been a Nazarite unto God from my mother’s womb: if I be shaven, then my strength will go from me, and I shall become weak, and be like any other man. (Judges 16:17)</i></p>


		  	<blockquote>Exposing your source of strength is giving an embrace to vulnerability.</blockquote>

		  	<p>Some secrets are shared with close friends, some are shared with family, and some others are shared with confidants alone.</p>
		  	<p>Sharing secrets with the wrong person has got some people in a mess, which they’ve struggled years to be redeemed from, yet cannot find any way out.</p>
		  	<p>The secret of some people is their strength, and some others, their weakness; however, in all cases, there are some secrets that are not to be shared or exposed.</p>
		  	<p>Samson was a bearer of an uncommon gift; his strength was something every man desired; some envied him, and others sought his downfall. The Philistines were willing to pay anything to capture him.</p>
		  	<p>His source of strength, which was his little secret, was the fact that he had never shaved his hair. The lifetime of Samson was determined by how long he was capable of concealing this secret.</p>
		  	<p>His downfall began when he exposed a secret that was meant to be concealed.</p>
		  	<p>Did Delilah really deserve to know the source of Samson’s strength? What good could she do, by knowing his source of strength? If Samson spared a moment to ask himself these questions, he would have understood that there was more to her persistent inquiry than it seemed.</p>
		  	<p>When people discover your source of strength, they try to drain it by any means they can. Exposing your source of strength is giving an embrace to vulnerability.</p>
		  	<p>Not everyone deserves to know everything about you; there are mysteries that are meant for you alone; there are dreams and visions that are not meant to be shared; there are secrets that are not meant for exposure.</p>
		  	<p>Samson’s act of revealing his source of strength to Delilah was not capable of edifying either of them. If the information I give you cannot edify, then it is better concealed than shared.</p>
		  	<p>It is good to have confidants, but also understand that enemies sometimes take the form of confidants, to gain access to the deeper parts of your life. Samson regarded Delilah as a confidant, but she was more of an enemy.</p>
		  	<p>Even some of those, whom you regard as confidants, are not worth sharing secrets with. There are revelations you just can’t share with anyone; there are topics you just can’t discuss with anyone; there are secrets that shouldn’t be exposed.</p>
		  	<p>Be careful who you call a confidant; learn how to be quiet on things that should not be said. Be blessed!</p>
