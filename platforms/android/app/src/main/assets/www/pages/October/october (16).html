		  	<p><i>That it might be fulfilled which was spoken by Esaias the prophet, saying, Himself took our infirmities, and bare our sicknesses. (Matthew 8:17)</i></p>
		  	

		  	<blockquote>Healing is no longer a promise that lies in the future, but the truth that abides forever.</blockquote>

		  	<p>He took our infirmities and bare our sicknesses? Notice, the scripture did not say, “He will take our infirmities, and will bare our sicknesses.” It uses past tense.</p>
		  	<p>In essence, our infirmities have been taken already; our sicknesses have been borne already. Verily, your healing is not ahead of you, but behind you! When you are ignorant of this truth, the enemy takes advantage of you.</p>
		  	<p>You know, the enemy has been defeated and made powerless ages ago; however, the only weapon he has is deceit, and the only advantage he has over any believer is ignorance! When you are ignorant, the enemy has an edge over you.</p>
		  	<p>In all thy getting, get understanding (Proverbs 4:7). Beloved, we need to understand these things . . . If you think your healing is ahead of you, you might end up spending your entire life on the sick-bed; but when you understand that you have been healed already, your sick bed will not be able to contain you anymore.</p>
		  	<p>When you allow faith to put your infirmity in the past, nothing holds you down anymore. Previously, we might have been promised healing; but that promise was fulfilled by the death and resurrection of Jesus. Thus, healing is no longer a promise that lies in the future, but the truth that abides forever. It is a fulfillment now!</p>
		  	<p>God has done what He will do; the ball is now in your court. He has borne our sicknesses and infirmity; don’t bear it a second time; it has been borne already.</p>
		  	<p>Sickness is one thing that should never be tolerated for a second; don’t negotiate with infirmities. One of the weirdest things I’ve heard is, “O, this malaria should please leave me alone.” When I heard this, I wondered, “Why do people still insist on bearing that, which has already been borne for them?”</p>
		  	<p>If you keep pleading with sickness to leave you, it will lead you to an early grave. Don’t plead with that, which has already been taken away.</p>
		  	<p>Have this mindset in you always; sickness is gone already; infirmities have been taken away long time ago; therefore, they no longer exist. The words sickness and infirmity were banned from my vocabulary, the moment I encountered this scripture.</p>
		  	<p>The Doctor might tell you that they have no cure for your disease, but when you understand that you have no disease in the first place, you’d not live in fear but faith. Our infirmities have been taken away already; do you believe that?</p>
		  	<p>When there is no disease, there is nothing to cure, so you needn’t be concerned about the report of the Doctor. Don’t be afraid of what the Doctors said; believe in what God says. Be blessed!</p>
