		  	<p><i>And Esau said to Jacob, Feed me, I pray thee, with that same red pottage; for I am faint: therefore was his name called Edom.</i></p>
		  	<p><i>And Jacob said, Sell me this day thy birthright. And Esau said, Behold, I am at the point to die: and what profit shall this birthright do to me?</i></p>
		  	<p><i>And Jacob said, Swear to me this day; and he sware unto him: and he sold his birthright unto Jacob. (Genesis 25:30-33)</i></p>


		  	<blockquote>Be careful what you give consent to. Never let your feelings lead you to compromise. Don’t starve your destiny for mere satisfaction.</blockquote>

		  	<p>There was a hunger Esau needed to satisfy, which led him to trade his destiny. Be careful the things you crave for. The world has got its own pleasures; these things look appetizing, it seems like the most convenient thing to do in order to feel good, but beware; some of these things are destiny killers.</p>
		  	<p><i>Dearly beloved, I beseech you as strangers and pilgrims, abstain from fleshly lusts, which war against the soul; (1 Peter 2:11).</i></p>
		  	<p>Talk about satisfaction... this was all Esau wanted at that point in time; it cost him his destiny</p>
		  	<p>Talk about rest... This was what David wanted at the spring season when Kings went to war; As a result, he met Bathsheba. This cost him his Kingship</p>
		  	<p>Talk about comfort... This was what Jonah wanted, at the expense of his divine assignment, he attempted escape; it cost him 3 nights in the belly of this fish.</p>
		  	<p>Talk about green pastures... This was what Lot saw, which led him to choose before his Uncle, Abraham; it rendered him homeless</p>
		  	<p>I’ve realized that everyone wants to be satisfied... Every youth wants to have fun... Everyone wants comfort. But you must realize that you are not your own. You are owned by God, and so at some season in your life, the Father might need you to drift a bit from your comfort zone, and get committed to His work.</p>
		  	<p>Don’t insist on comfort like Jonah did... Don’t insist on rest like David did... Don’t insist on a beautiful place like Lot did... Don’t insist on porridge like Esau did... Sometimes, these little aspects of comfort could cause a swap in destiny. Do you want to be comfortable or you want your destiny?</p>
		  	<p>I don’t think Esau was sensitive enough to the conditions of Jacob, he took it for granted. The desire and dire need of satisfaction made him not to think twice about his brothers’ condition for the offer of food. Be careful what you give consent to... Never let your feelings lead you to compromise. Like Esau, you may not see the effects instantly, but the nemesis will come knocking shortly.</p>
		  	<p>Be sensitive enough to know when it’s time to rise. Give some more commitment to your Divine assignment, it constitutes your purpose. Don’t starve your destiny for mere satisfaction. Today, take a step further, act on what God has called you to do. Enough of the procrastination!</p>
