		  <div class="panel-body" style="text-align:justify">


		  	<p><i>Then shall the kingdom of heaven be likened unto ten virgins, which took their lamps, and went forth to meet the bridegroom.</i></p>
		  	<p><i>And five of them were wise, and five were foolish. (Matthew 25:1-2)</i></p>
		  	

		  	<blockquote>There is no point attaining a height, which you cannot be sustained in; virginity without attitude is a plague; it gets you exalted, and smashes you down in no time.</blockquote>

		  	<p>Virginity will qualify you at the initial stage, but it is not enough to sustain you till the end.</p>
		  	<p>There is something special about the parable of the ten virgins; did you notice that all the ten ladies had something in common—virginity! But not all of them were qualified. This simply proves the fact that sometimes, virginity is not enough!</p>
		  	<p>Virginity qualified them to enter into the courts to wait for the bridegroom, but lack of wisdom drove some of them out of that same court. In essence, virginity can take you there, but it is not enough to keep you there — you need wisdom!</p>
		  	<p>Virginity was one of the key qualifications of Mary, but that was not all. I believe there were many other virgins in the city, but Mary was chosen.</p>
		  	<p>Abraham’s servant looked for a virgin who will meet his requirements; I believe that virginity was not the only qualification of Rebekah. The servant must have seen many other virgins, but only Rebekah met his other requirements. There was more to his requirement than being a virgin; he needed someone, with a good attitude and heart, who could fend for him and his camels.</p>
		  	<p>You might be qualified by virginity at the initial stage, but can your attitude sustain you there? There is no point attaining a position, which you cannot be sustained in.</p>
		  	<p>Queen Vashti was already in a royal position. I assume she was a virgin, because in those days, kings only married virgins. However, she was driven out of that position, and replaced by another, simply because she did not have the right attitude to sustain her there. Virginity might have qualified her for the position, but folly made her to lose it. Verily, virginity is not enough!</p>
		  	<p>There is no point flying a plane in such a great altitude and height, when it cannot be preserved in the air. While the plane is on the runway, it might not need much to move, but when it ascends to greater heights; it requires so much more to be sustained there.</p>
		  	<p>There is no point attaining a height, which you cannot be sustained in; virginity without attitude is a plague; it gets you exalted, and smashes you down in no time.</p>
		  	<p>As explained in previous study, Daniel, Shedrach, Meshach and Abednego preserved their virginity by being undefiled by the fats of the kings’ house. This qualified them for recognition before the king, but it was not enough to preserve them when greater trials emerged.</p>
		  	<p>The joy is not just in being undefiled, but being equipped with enough oil in your lamp. Ten of the ladies were qualified to wait by their virginity, but five of them lacked enough oil to be sustained.</p>
		  	<p>Much more than you desire to remain undefiled, preserve your oil. Be blessed!</p>
