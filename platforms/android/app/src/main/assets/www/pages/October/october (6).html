		  	<p><i>And Jacob awaked out of his sleep, and he said, Surely the Lord is in this place; and I knew it not.</i></p>
		  	<p><i>And he was afraid, and said, How dreadful is this place! this is none other but the house of God, and this is the gate of heaven. (Genesis 28:16-17)</i></p>

		  	<blockquote>It might be difficult to see the hand of God when situations are very hard, but He is always there.</blockquote>

		  	<p>From an intense meditation on the lines of Jacob, we realize that he attests to the truth that even when things were tough, God was there. He portrays that God has always been there, but he is just realizing it.</p>
		  	<p>Due to the hardness of the place (a place where stones were used as pillows) where Jacob tarried, he failed to realize that the Lord was there. It was not until he slept and saw a blessed vision, that he realized that he dwelled in the house of God.</p>
		  	<p>Just like Jacob, some of us have been through all manner of hardships, privation, destitution and penury. Because of the severity of our predicament, it might be easy to embrace the thought that God is not with us.</p>
		  	<p>I have met many people, who have argued endlessly in a bid to prove to me that God has forsaken them. They go as far as saying, “If He was here, I wouldn’t have suffered penury; if He was here, I wouldn’t have lost all I had; if He was here, I wouldn’t have been kicked out of my house”</p>
		  	<p>Even Lazarus sister acted in like manner; she told Jesus that if He had been there, Lazarus would not have died. The present situation made her to think that God was not in her home.</p>
		  	<p>Beloved, God is omnipresent; He is our ever present help in times of trouble. Sometimes the delay is not as a result of God’s absence, but for our own good. Jesus had a genuine reason for tarrying till Lazarus died; this did not mean that He was not with them.</p>
		  	<p>Verily, Jesus was with Lazarus, even before He physically visited his house. If He could heal the centurion’s servant without physically appearing in his house, then it is obvious that He is everywhere.</p>
		  	<p>It took Jacob, looking back on his situation, to realize that God had always been there, but he never knew. It took me looking back at my life to realize that even in my iniquity, God loved me and was there; perhaps, I just didn’t realize it until now.</p>
		  	<p>Now, I thank God for letting me to go through the fire, the storms and the delay, for it was for my good. It might be difficult to see the hand of God when situations are very hard, but He is always there.</p>
		  	<p>Only trust Him to make the best, even out of the worst situation. Be blessed!</p>
