		  	<p><i>So now faith, hope, and love abide, these three; but the greatest of these is love. (1 Corinthians 13:13 ESV)</i></p>
		  	

		  	<blockquote>It is impossible to live a fulfilled Christian life without a blend of faith, hope and love. A life without this three-fold chord is a life that lacks harmony.</blockquote>

		  	<p>Our focus today will be on the first aspect of this scripture—faith, hope and love. These are the three-fold chord.</p>
		  	<p>A chord in musical terms, is a group of notes that sound together and form a perfect harmony; likewise, faith, hope and love are a group of virtues that blend together to yield the most perfect Christian life.</p>
		  	<p>I must state, it is impossible to live a fulfilled Christian life without a blend of faith, hope and love. A life without this three-fold chord is a life that lacks harmony. Sadly, many people are living off tune.</p>
		  	<p>Generally, a chord is understood to be a straight line, which joins the ends of arcs or objects. Without a chord, objects will easily be dispersed in different directions. Therefore, the chord is known for bringing connection and unity amongst members.</p>
		  	<p>Faith, hope and love are the three-fold chord, which plays the key role in uniting members of the body of Christ. A family that lacks love is hardly united; a man that lacks faith and hope cannot be connected to God’s Realm of Life.</p>
		  	<p>Many Christians pray without receiving, simply because they lack that connection to God’s realm, which is propelled by the blend of faith and hope. Many groups, associations and bodies are in shambles, because they lack love.</p>
		  	<p>Faith is the assurance of things hoped for; love binds everything together in perfect harmony. In Colossians 3, after we are admonished to put on a new self of meekness, humility, self-control, and others, it is clearly stated that above all things, we should put on love, which binds everything together in perfect harmony.</p>
		  	<p>Previously, we studied hope as being the value of faith; with careful illustrations, it was concluded that these two are interrelated. They work together just like plants and fertilizers. In order to be productive, the plant needs fertilizers; likewise, without plants, the fertilizers are of no use. Hope is the plant, and faith is the fertilizer.</p>
		  	<p>However, as great as it is to have a blend of faith and hope, we also need love, to bind everything together in perfect harmony. Faith and hope are good virtues, but when there is no love, they amount to nothing!</p>
		  	<p>Having done all things to have precise expectations, and hope, fertilize your hope with faith; having done all to blend your faith and hope, bind them all together in love.</p>
		  	<p>Subsequently, we will lay emphasis on the second aspect of the scripture, and understand the greatest of all—love. Be blessed!</p>
