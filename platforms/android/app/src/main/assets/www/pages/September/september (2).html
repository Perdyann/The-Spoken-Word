		  	<p><i>And the woman conceived, and bare a son at that season that Elisha had said unto her, according to the time of life.</i></p>
		  	<p><i>And when the child was grown, it fell on a day, that he went out to his father to the reapers.</i></p>
		  	<p><i>And when he had taken him, and brought him to his mother, he sat on her knees till noon, and then died. (2 Kings 4:17-18 & 20)</i></p>


		  	<blockquote>Don’t lay in the tomb, that which should be laid in the hands of God.</blockquote>

		  	<p>God’s gift cannot be revoked, withdrawn, changed or reversed. Against all odds, His Word stands firm.</p>
		  	<p>Behold the case of the Shunammite woman, who had lost all hope of having a child, for her husband was old. At such a hopeless season of her life, the Prophet, Elisha gave her a Word, that she shall have a son.</p>
		  	<p>As impossible as it seemed initially, it came to be. There was no doubt that the son was God’s gift to her; there was no doubt that the child was the answer to her prayers; there was no doubt that God had taken away her shame. God ushered in a ray of hope, when there seemed to be no hope.</p>
		  	<p>Beloved, in no time, this child suffered a sudden illness, and was pronounced dead. At this juncture, the Shunammite woman could have easily doubted the authenticity of God’s Word, she could have cursed God for giving her a promise, which He could not sustain; she could have cursed God for giving her hope, and replacing it with shame. But no!</p>
		  	<p>She chose to believe that the gift of God is irrevocable. She held God on that Word; she knew that God wouldn’t bring her that far, just to let her down; She knew that God wouldn’t give her a gift, which He cannot sustain. Furthermore, it states,</p>
		  	<p><i>And she went up, and laid him on the bed of the man of God, and shut the door upon him, and went out. (2 Kings 4:21)</i></p>
		  	<p>Beloved, a child, whom ordinarily she would have buried upon his death, she preserved; because, she knew that he was not just a child, but a gift from God.</p>
		  	<p>A child, whom she should have laid in the tomb, she laid in the bed of the Prophet. Likewise, don’t lay in the tomb, that which should be laid in the hands of God. Don’t bury that gift yet.</p>
		  	<p>How often have we buried gifts that we should have prophesied upon? Don’t take anything to the tomb, when you can take it to God.</p>
		  	<p>Because of the faith and persistence of this Woman, that child lived again. Likewise, the Lord has given us gifts, and deposited so much within us; sometimes, it seems like these gifts are no more. Sometimes it seems like you are all empty within.</p>
		  	<p>Have this consciousness always, the gift of God is irrevocable; if it is from God, it cannot have an untimely end; if it is from God, it cannot be withdrawn.</p>
		  	<p>Samson’s hair was his gift; he let out the secret to a supposed confidant, and she shaved his hair. However, it is important to understand that the hair eventually grew back, and he killed even more at his death than he did in his lifetime. God’s gift cannot be revoked; even when it seems like it’s lost, you can always recover it.</p>
		  	<p>God’s gift is for a purpose, and it cannot end outside that purpose. The gift might seem dead, but there’s still a little spark within; fan it to flames. Be blessed!</p>
