		  	<p><i>So Naaman came with his horses and with his chariot, and stood at the door of the house of Elisha.</i></p>
		  	<p><i>And Elisha sent a messenger unto him, saying, Go and wash in Jordan seven times, and thy flesh shall come again to thee, and thou shalt be clean.</i></p>
		  	<p><i>But Naaman was wroth, and went away, and said, Behold, I thought, He will surely come out to me, and stand, and call on the name of the Lord his God, and strike his hand over the place, and recover the leper.</i></p>
		  	<p><i>Are not Abana and Pharpar, rivers of Damascus, better than all the waters of Israel? may I not wash in them, and be clean? So he turned and went away in a rage.</i></p>
		  	<p><i>And his servants came near, and spake unto him, and said, My father, if the prophet had bid thee do some great thing, wouldest thou not have done it? how much rather then, when he saith to thee, Wash, and be clean?</i></p>
		  	<p><i>Then went he down, and dipped himself seven times in Jordan, according to the saying of the man of God: and his flesh came again like unto the flesh of a little child, and he was clean. (2 Kings 5:9-14)</i></p>


		  	<blockquote>You cannot predict God. If you are too used to God speaking through the wind, you will miss out when He shows up in the earthquake.</blockquote>

		  	<p>Naaman went to meet Prophet Elisha to heal him, for he was infected with leprosy. The least he expected of Elisha was to come outside, see him, and then say an open prayer for him.</p>
		  	<p>His expectations were short when Elisha did not bother coming out, but rather sent a messenger to tell him to wash at river Jordan. This really got him upset; obviously, if his healing was in the water, there are so many cleaner waters; he shouldn’t have bothered journeying all the way.</p>
		  	<p>Just like Naaman, sometimes, people pray but never have faith enough to get healed until their pastors lay hands on them. Naaman was upset because he did not believe that his healing could come so easily; he expected the man of God to lay hands on him, or pray for some hours.</p>
		  	<p>Jesus gave us the Holy Spirit when He left; He did not leave us helpless. Therefore, you can receive your healing in your bedroom; you can pray effectively during your quiet time; you can get saved right now. You don’t need a 3 days deliverance session to get healed; you don’t need an altar call to get saved. Only believe!</p>
		  	<p>In the Old Testament, as much as they did not have the Holy Ghost resident in them, they had Prophets and Apostles through whom God acted. All that was required of Naaman was to believe in the Words of the Prophet, but no! Naaman had a means through which he expected God to act.</p>
		  	<p>Sometimes, God does not just show up in the way we expect Him to. It is written,</p>
		  	<p><i>And he said, Go forth, and stand upon the mount before the Lord. And, behold, the Lord passed by, and a great and strong wind rent the mountains, and brake in pieces the rocks before the Lord; but the Lord was not in the wind: and after the wind an earthquake; but the Lord was not in the earthquake:</i></p>
		  	<p><i>And after the earthquake a fire; but the Lord was not in the fire: and after the fire a still small voice. (1 Kings 19:11-12)</i></p>
		  	<p>Elijah looked for God in the strong wind, but He was not there; he looked in the earthquake, but God was not there; he searched through the fire, but God was not there; rather, God spoke with a still small voice.</p>
		  	<p>You cannot predict God. If you are too used to God speaking through the wind, you will miss out when He shows up in the earthquake. If you are too used to having God show up in the fire, you might miss out, when He decides to speak with a still small voice.</p>
		  	<p>If you are too used to receiving revelations only through dreams, you might miss out when God decides to speak with a still small voice. Naaman had tagged God for healing in a certain way, but God decided to heal through a wash in the Jordan; he nearly missed it!</p>
		  	<p>Do not create a certain pattern in your mind, by which you expect God to meet your needs. God is not predictable, be blessed!</p>
