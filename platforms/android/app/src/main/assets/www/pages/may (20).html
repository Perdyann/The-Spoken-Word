		  	<p><i>And Saul said to David, Thou art not able to go against this Philistine to fight with him: for thou art but a youth, and he a man of war from his youth. (1 Samuel 17:33)</i></p>

		  	<blockquote>Before God knitted you in your mother’s womb, He had already qualified you for your purpose, and every mandate that comes in line with it. Don’t allow anyone make you feel incompetent now... </blockquote>

		  	<p>There’s something really amazing about the turn-out of this story: Did you notice that although David was not qualified by men to join the army, he was qualified by God for the anointing. Being in the army does not guarantee victory, but the anointing does.</p>
		  	<p>Saul, by merely looking at the youthful age and statue of David, had already disqualified him. Goliath had more experience and training, but David only seemed like an amateur adolescent.</p>
		  	<p>Eliab was angry with David, when he dared to show his face amongst the members of the army. He said, <i> “ ... with whom hast thou left those few sheep in the wilderness? I know thy pride, and the naughtiness of thine heart; for thou art come down that thou mightest see the battle.” (vs. 28) </i></p>
		  	<p>By this speech, he was insinuating that David’s place is with the Sheep and not the army. His statement also implied that David must have come to watch the battle, without thoughts of partaking in it. This statement was out of disbelief; he could never assume that David was capable of challenging Goliath.</p>
		  	<p>Beloved, while men were busy disqualifying David on the basis of his age, statue, youthfulness, inexperience, God was qualifying him for something even greater, because of his heart of faith.</p>
		  	<p>Isn’t it funny how sometimes people disqualify you for some positions, by merely taking a look at you; what they don’t know is, God has already qualified you for a greater position; their opinion about your competence does not count.</p>
		  	<p>Sometimes we disqualify people on the basis of their inexperience, but the truth is: whom the Lord qualifies, none can disqualify.</p>
		  	<p>Before the Lord told Samuel to anoint David, He had already qualified him for the position of Kingship, and every other assignments and challenges that will come with it. Other men were merely wasting their time when they tried to make David feel incompetent.</p>
		  	<p>Beloved, understand today, that before God knitted you in your mother’s womb, He had already qualified you for your purpose, and every mandate that comes in line with it. Don’t allow anyone make you feel incompetent now. You are the one, whom God has qualified for that assignment; it doesn’t matter what the multitude have to say.</p>
		  	<p>There’s something lovable about the way David referred to the armies. He never referred to them as the armies of the Israelites, but the armies of the living God.</p>
		  	<p>Men disqualified him from joining the armies of the Israelites, but the LORD chose and anointed him to represent the armies of the living God.</p>
		  	<p>Beloved, you were not chosen by men, but God. Therefore, you are the chosen of God. Anyone (Philistine) that tries to stand in the way of your purpose is only creating a battle, not against you, but God. God never loses battles!</p>
		  	<p>Have this understanding always, you have already been qualified by God for your call; the opinion of man is void of any more effect. God has made you able to defeat every giant ahead. Cheer up... Be blessed!</p>
