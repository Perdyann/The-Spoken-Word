		  	<p><i>The very night before Herod was about to bring him forth, Peter was sleeping between two soldiers, fastened with two chains, and sentries before the door were guarding the prison. </i></p>
			<p><i>And suddenly an angel of the Lord appeared [standing beside him], and a light shone in the place where he was. And the angel gently smote Peter on the side and awakened him, saying, Get up quickly! And the chains fell off his hands . . . And [Peter] went out [along] following him, and he was not conscious that what was apparently being done by the angel was real, but thought he was seeing a vision.</i></p>
			<p><i>When they had passed through the first guard and the second, they came to the iron gate which leads into the city. Of its own accord [the gate] swung open, and they went out and passed on through one street; and at once the angel left him.</i></p>
			<p><i>Then Peter came to himself and said, Now I really know and am sure that the Lord has sent His angel and delivered me from the hand of Herod and from all that the Jewish people were expecting [to do to me]. (Acts 12:6-11)</i></p>

		  	<p style="text-align:justify">I am excited by the very first line of the passage . . . it makes us to understand that it was the very night before Peter was to face possible prosecution. That is, the last hours to his unpredictable judgment. At such an hour, rather than being worried, restless or anxious, Peter was asleep. He was in a state of rest. There is nothing as good as finding rest in God, even in the midst of turbulence.</p>
		  	<p style="text-align:justify">More exciting is the fact that the angel of God did not come to Peter’s rescue at the initial stage of his imprisonment . . . it happened at the last hours. Sometimes God needs you to be able to wait on Him. When you are in the midst of turbulence, and the situation is only getting worse and tough, then find consolation in the fact that you might just be at the verge of your breakthrough.</p>
		  	<p style="text-align:justify">Don’t give up . . . You are much closer than you think; your miracle might just be waiting for the last hours to be manifest. The breakthrough often comes at the last hour, and it happens just like a dream.</p>
		  	<p style="text-align:justify">Did you notice how the release of Peter, from the Prison to the city happened? Just like a dream! Isn’t it amazing how the angel came to Peter’s rescue, and walked him through, from the Prison (A place of limitation, slavery, and captivity), to the city (a land flowing with milk and honey; a place of absolute freedom) . . .</p>
		  	<p style="text-align:justify">All these while, Peter thought it was a mere dream. It was not until he approached freedom that he really came back to himself. He didn’t need to bother about how it was going to happen . . . He didn’t need to struggle to get out!</p>
		  	<p style="text-align:justify">Likewise, some people really want to devote themselves to the things of God, but somehow, their environment is a huge limitation. Hear ye the Word of the Lord. God says that He is going to lead you out of that mess just like a dream. He will walk you through, from the place where you are now, to your promise land, and to the centre of your assignment just like a dream.</p>
		  	<p style="text-align:justify">Furthermore, notice from verse 10, that as soon as they approached the gate, he didn’t need to struggle to get himself released . . . The gates swung open of their own accord! Isn’t it amazing the way God works? God will open up doors of favor unto you . . . You will not need to spend time and energy pushing your way through. Your presence will send a divine signal to doors, and they will open up automatically to you.</p>
		  	<p style="text-align:justify">If you are in a mess today, don’t be discouraged, don’t think of how and when you will get through . . . just receive this word. Your breakthrough is on the way, and it will happen suddenly, just like a dream. You’d only wake up to the reality of everything, when you are already out of that ill situation.</p>
		  	<p style="text-align:justify">There’s something spectacular to be observed when you study ahead of this Word. You’d realize that the visitation which led to the release of Peter emanated from the gathering of the Church in prayers. Understand that whenever there is a gathering of brethren in one accord, something happens!</p>
		  	<p style="text-align:justify">The Pentecost was a result of the gathering of brethren, and likewise the release of Peter. Whenever 2 or 3 are gathered together in the name of Jesus, He is in their midst.</p>
		  	<p style="text-align:justify">Today, have a fellowship with your family, friends, or neighbors. Join hands in one accord, and pray, edifying yourselves . . . Be at watch for a Divine result. There will be a divine visitation, which will result in your sweatless release. Only believe! Your breakthrough is on the way!</p>
		  	<p style="text-align:justify">So many times I climbed mountains without knowing . . . I only got to know the magnitude of what I climbed when I was already on top of it. Your breakthrough will come just like a dream! Amen!</p>
