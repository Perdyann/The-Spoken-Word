		  	<p><i>And when he came to himself, he said, How many hired servants of my father’s have bread enough and to spare, and I perish with hunger!</i></p>
		  	<p><i>I will arise and go to my father, and will say unto him, Father, I have sinned against heaven, and before thee, (Luke 15:17-18)</i></p>


		  	<blockquote>No matter how far you have strayed, as long as you can come back to yourself, you can always get back to the promise you deliberately walked away from. </blockquote>

		  	<p>Have you ever looked back on decisions you previously made, and realized how unreasonable they were? Sometimes, I wonder, what was I thinking when I did that? Verily, I was not with my right mind or senses at that point.</p>
		  	<p>That was the exact situation the prodigal son was caught up in. He had made decisions that were unthinkable, and acted in a very irresponsible way. However, when everything he had was spent, it was as though scales just fell off his eyes, and he came to himself.</p>
		  	<p>It was not until he got back to his right senses, that he realized how foolish he had been all the while. His restoration only began when he got back to his mind.</p>
		  	<p>Just like the Prodigal son; acting in folly is not what is keeping you from your father’s house, but not having your right mind with you, to realize how foolish you’ve been. No matter how far you have strayed, as long as you can come back to yourself, you can always get back to the promise you deliberately walked away from.</p>
		  	<p>Notice that the Prodigal son intended returning to his father as a slave, but his father, having waited for his return with so much anticipation, gladly embraced and welcomed him back to the position of a son, despite all he had done.</p>
		  	<p>The prodigal son must have heard the saying, “you cannot eat your cake and have it.” Due to that, he felt he can never be a son again, having spent his inheritance already. But that was not the way his father saw it; his father celebrated his return more than his initial presence.</p>
		  	<p>Likewise, no matter how far we have strayed from God; no matter how much we have acted in folly; no matter how wrong our decisions have been; no matter how undeserving we are of God’s love; He still loves us.</p>
		  	<p>God knows that in the era of your folly, you were not operating with your right mindset, and so He is patiently waiting for you to come back to yourself and be restored.</p>
		  	<p>Some people say, “I can never be as close to God as I was ten years ago; then I had not disappointed him as I am doing now; Even if God forgives me, He will never let me be that close to Him again.” This is a lie from the pit of hell.</p>
		  	<p>Just like the Father received the prodigal son to a more celebrated position than he was before, God will even more, receive us to a realm higher than we have ever known.</p>
		  	<p>There is need for revival! The people of God have strayed from the first truth and love. Return to the LORD and He will return to you.</p>
		  	<p>No matter how unthinkable and abominable your deeds have been, if you can come back to yourself and if you can get your mind back, you can be reestablished and repositioned for greater in God. Be blessed!</p>
