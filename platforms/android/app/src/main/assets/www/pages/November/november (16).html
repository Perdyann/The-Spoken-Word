		  	<p><i>Thus saith the LORD; Cursed be the man that trusteth in man, and maketh flesh his arm, and whose heart departeth from the LORD.</i></p>
		  	<p><i>For he shall be like the heath in the desert, and shall not see when good cometh; but shall inhabit the parched places in the wilderness, in a salt land and not inhabited. (Jeremiah 17:5-6)</i></p>
	

		  	<blockquote>The Word of God works marvelous wonders, which many surgical operations cannot perform.</blockquote>

		  	<p>If I were to ask a group of people what gives them an assurance that the future is bright, I’m certain that the response from quite a number of them will portray that they hope in things and means that are not of God.</p>
		  	<p>What gives you the assurance that you will not be homeless tomorrow? Is it your career, family or friends? Some people have gone as far as making statements to fellow men, such as “You are my last hope ...”</p>
		  	<p>No man is my hope at all, not to talk about being my last hope. How dare you refer to a man as your last hope? What happened to God? The best and only surgeon in town is not even qualified to be your last hope. The Word of God works marvelous wonders, which many surgical operations cannot perform.</p>
		  	<p>The scripture rightly states that doom awaits a man, whose trust is in a fellow man; a man, who hopes in human strength, ability and efforts, is bound to fail.</p>
		  	<p>On Christ the Solid Rock I stand, all other ground is sinking sand. Any ground that is not Christ, is bound to sink! I will never opt for Life Insurance. My life is insured in Christ and nothing else!</p>
		  	<p>No matter how professional a Doctor is, he cannot guarantee life; no matter how well-paying a job is, it cannot guarantee a future; no matter how great the economy seems, it cannot guarantee prosperity; no matter how respected your academic degree and background is, it cannot guarantee success.</p>
		  	<p>Isn’t it obvious that all other ground is sinking sand? A wealth family background cannot guarantee a bright future. Placing your trust in men is like swapping your original life with a counterfeit.</p>
		  	<p>The system of the world is not worth your trust. The economy has never been stable; everything is bound to change and pass away, but the Word of the Lord. Why then will you choose to rely on that, which will pass away, rather than that, which is eternal?</p>
		  	<p>It is interesting to note that immediately after doom is pronounced for those, who put their trust in men, great blessings are released on those who trust solely on God.</p>
		  	<p>Martin Luther King once said—I have held many things in my hands and lost them all, but that, which I placed in the hands of God, I still possess.</p>
		  	<p>Trusting in men will only result in painful loses; but a man, who relies solely on God, is bound to do exploits. Be blessed!</p>
