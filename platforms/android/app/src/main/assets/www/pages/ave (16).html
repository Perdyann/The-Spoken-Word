		  	<p><i>And said to him, Everyone else serves his best wine first, and when people have drunk freely, then he serves that which is not so good; but you have kept back the good wine until now! (John 2:10)</i></p>

		  	<blockquote>If you are waiting for a restoration, then your best days are probably in the past. God does more than just restoration; He remodels and reshapes greater things! </blockquote>

		  	<p>Gazing intently on this scripture, I observed a trend, which prompted me to study deeper. Generally, men love to exhaust their best resources first, before they could settle for the worse. However, God preserves the best for the last.</p>
		  	<p>Jesse had many sons, but there was something lacking in all of them, which was preserved, and fully deposited in his last son, David. Joseph’s Father had many sons earlier, but there was a mantle of greatness, preserved for the last, Joseph. These are not just instances of physical coincidence, but spiritual significance.</p>
		  	<p>When people approach me in a mess, rather than show them pity, I only encourage them with this truth — Things can only get better — Your best days are yet to come. It is written:</p>
		  	<p><i>And the Lord blessed the latter days of Job more than his beginning; (Job 42:12)</i></p>
		  	<p>Job was a great man from the beginning, even though he was eventually tried. However, when he had overcome trials, his former days were nothing comparable to his latter days. Even in the climax of his initial great days, he had not tasted a tip of what was preserved for his last days.</p>
		  	<p>Beloved, when you are in Christ, you can only ascend from great heights, to greater. Your life cannot be full of ups and downs; we cannot have better yesterdays than today.</p>
		  	<p>Just when they had run out of wine in the wedding at Cana, and probably felt hopeless, Jesus gave them something better than what they initially had. Jesus did not restore wine to them at the wedding, He gave them something better, and of more quality than what they had.</p>
		  	<p>According to the English dictionary, the meaning of restore is: return something to a former condition, place or position. If we are to abide by that definition, God does not restore!</p>
		  	<p>The translation of the scripture from its original language (Greek), was not done by Christians alone, thus, some misconception was made. The Greek word for restore is ἀναπλάσσω (Anaplassv), meaning reshape, remodel or redevelop. Verily, God never returns us to our previous position or condition. What He does, is to reshape and reposition us to be greater than the past.</p>
		  	<p>If you are waiting for a restoration, then your best days are probably in the past. God does more than just restoration; He remodels and reshapes greater things!</p>
		  	<p>The biblical definition of restoration contrasts that of the dictionary; naturally, restoration gives you what you had before; but spiritually, God restores our soul by giving us something more than what we had previously.</p>
		  	<p>Beloved, even in the situation of losing all you once had (like Job), have this mindset—God will not just restore it, but give you greater than you ever had or imagined. It doesn’t matter what you may be going through today, bear in mind that things can only get better.</p>
		  	<p>Your latter will be greater than your past. Be blessed!</p>
