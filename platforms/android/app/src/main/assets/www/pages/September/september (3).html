		  	<p><i>But Daniel purposed in his heart that he would not defile himself with the portion of the king’s meat, nor with the wine which he drank: therefore he requested of the prince of the eunuchs that he might not defile himself. (Daniel 1:8)</i></p>
		  	


		  	<blockquote>Any goal that requires a compromising action is not worth achieving.</blockquote>

		  	<p>You don’t need to compromise your stands to achieve your goals. Any goal that requires a compromising action is not worth achieving. Daniel understood that without the meat or wine of the King, he could still look fresh and healthy.</p>
		  	<p>Daniel did not need to be defiled in order to be recognized. When he had set his standards, without going back on it, and when the time for their display to the king arrived, he and his fellows looked even better than those who had trusted in the fats of the kings for nourishment.</p>
		  	<p>Verily, your qualification is not guaranteed by your defilement, but by the standards you have set. You can be chosen, even without compromising your stands.</p>
		  	<p>It is embarrassing the manner at which people compromise their faith, and defile themselves, in a pursuit of vainglory. They give up who they are to achieve worthless titles and positions; the ambitiousness of many has left their reputation stuck in the mud.</p>
		  	<p>Daniel, Shedrach, Meshach and Abednego might not have had meat and wine, but unarguably, one thing they preserved against all odds was their reputation.</p>
		  	<p>You can be successful and prosperous in your business, academics and political affairs, without getting your hands defiled. Never buy the idea that ninety nine percent of successful men, had to compromise at some point; it is a poor mentality!</p>
		  	<p>Things obtained through means of defilement do not last; but treasures genuinely gotten, outlives the obtainer. Don’t be in a haste to get something that will soon be lost, set a Godly standard, and achieve great treasures that are eternal.</p>
		  	<p>You must not tell a lie to be promoted; you must not add false details to your curriculum vitae (CV) to be considered for any position; you must not sell your body to obtain material treasures; you must not bribe to obtain favor. Any treasure that requires a compromise is not worth getting.</p>
		  	<p>Genuine treasure will never be affixed with a requirement of defilement. If you need to be defiled to get to any destination, then you’re better off not embarking on that journey.</p>
		  	<p>Your real destiny has no requirement of you compromising your faith, or being defiled; any destiny that bears this requirement is a counterfeit that is not meant for you.</p>
		  	<p>Just like Daniel and his colleagues were recognized as the best despite their stands; you can be chosen for greater things without defiling yourself. Be blessed!</p>
