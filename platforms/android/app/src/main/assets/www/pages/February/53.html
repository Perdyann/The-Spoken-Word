		  	<p><i>Brethren, I count not myself to have apprehended: but this one thing I do, forgetting those things which are behind, and reaching forth unto those things which are before,</i></p>
		  	<p><i>I press toward the mark for the prize of the high calling of God in Christ Jesus. (Philippians 3:13-14)</i></p>
		


		  	<blockquote>Don’t let the damage of your past destroy the chances of a better future.</blockquote>

		  	<p>Forgetting what lies behind... Straining towards what is ahead. Life does not give us all we need at the time we desire it, but there is one liberty life presents - Choice! Indeed, life leaves every man with nothing but a choice.</p>
		  	<p>You could choose to dwell in the shadows of your past, OR you could choose to embrace the glory of the future. You could choose to remain in the ditch of your fall, OR you could choose to rise to a new dawn. You could choose to hold on to things that are long gone, OR you could choose to let go, and grab something new.</p>
		  	<p>In all these, we must realise, like Paul did, that until we forget the thing which are behind us, we cannot reach forth to the things which are ahead.</p>
		  	<p>In this season, God is trying to give us something new, but as long as we remain acquainted with the past things, we cannot receive anything. Indeed, a man has got to close the previous chapter of a book, before he can commence reading the next chapter.</p>
		  	<p>God needs to connect us to the people we need, but the people we have are hindering the new connection. It is written:</p>
		  	<p><i>Remember ye not the former things, neither consider the things of old.</i></p>
		  	<p><i>Behold, I will do a new thing; now it shall spring forth; shall ye not know it? I will even make a way in the wilderness, and rivers in the desert. (Isaiah 43:18-19)</i></p>
		  	<p>Forget about the pains, sadness and sorrows of yesterday... Don’t let the damage of your past destroy the chances of a better future. God’s getting ready to do the impossible in our lives, but we need to let go of the former things.</p>
		  	<p>Something new is about to be done, but we need to cease considering the old things. Choose ye this day which you will embrace; will you embrace the problems of yesterday or the promises of a better tomorrow? Will you stick to the limited former rain, or will you embrace the overflowing latter rain?</p>
		  	<p>There is a passion in me today, to declare to someone that your former days don’t equal the future. The latter will be greater than the past.</p>
		  	<p>Whatever you have today, wherever you stand today, and whoever you are today is nothing compared to what you will become tomorrow. Only let go of your past mistakes, life and mindset. Embrace something new!</p>
		  	<p><i>Neither do men put new wine into old bottles: else the bottles break, and the wine runneth out, and the bottles perish: but they put new wine into new bottles, and both are preserved (Matthew 9:17)</i></p>
		  	<p>It is a new season! The trial to blend the old, with a little bit of the new, will only result in the loss of everything. We cannot enter a new season with an old mindset.</p>
		  	<p>Ponder on these words today. It’s time to drift from the past to the future! We must forget what lies behind, and strain towards the goal ahead. Rise up, shake off, and get going... Be blessed!</p>
