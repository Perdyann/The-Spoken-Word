		  	<p><i>And Jabez was more honourable than his brethren: and his mother called his name Jabez, saying, Because I bare him with sorrow.</i></p>
		  	<p><i>And Jabez called on the God of Israel, saying, Oh that thou wouldest bless me indeed, and enlarge my coast, and that thine hand might be with me, and that thou wouldest keep me from evil, that it may not grieve me! And God granted him that which he requested. (1 Chronicles 4:9-10)</i></p>

		  	<blockquote>You are closer than you think; don’t give up!You are just one action away; don’t be too discouraged to act. </blockquote>

		  	<p>Jabez was one of such kinds, to whom a plague was affixed, right from birth. He bore the stigma of sorrows. For each time his mother called him, she was tormented with painful memories.</p>
		  	<p>Whenever the name Jabez was mentioned, sorrows gathered like cloud in the atmosphere. He was tagged with such disgrace. Everyone perceived him to be a bearer of sorrow.</p>
		  	<p>However, Jabez, rather than being discouraged by his ordeal, chose to break off the plague, and live greater than his name. It was from the deep promptings of his plague, that this great life-changing prayer was made.</p>
		  	<p>Behold another individual to whom a plague was affixed: <i> And a certain woman, which had an issue of blood twelve years,</i></p>
		  	<p><i>And had suffered many things of many physicians, and had spent all that she had, and was nothing bettered, but rather grew worse,</i></p>
		  	<p><i>When she had heard of Jesus, came in the press behind, and touched his garment.</i></p>
		  	<p><i>For she said, If I may touch but his clothes, I shall be whole.</i></p>
		  	<p><i>And straightway the fountain of her blood was dried up; and she felt in her body that she was healed of that plague. (Mark 5:25-29)</i></p>
		  	<p>I have asked over a million people what the name of the woman with the issue of blood is, yet, there’s been no answer to my question. Almost everyone addressed her by her plague rather than her name.</p>
		  	<p>One of the worst things that could happen to any individual is for his predicament to overshadow his name. She was in such a shameful ordeal for over a decade... She spent all her living, but only got worse over the years... a pity!</p>
		  	<p>However, like Jabez, this lady, rather than being depressed by her ordeal, pressed through to her breakthrough. She was determined to break off the plague at all cost.</p>
		  	<p>Many of us have not been through half as much as these individuals went through, yet we wallow in depression all day long. If we were to be in such a shame of an issue of blood, we may never have been confident enough to step an inch out of our home. If we were to be tagged with such a disgrace as Jabez was, we may never have been faithful enough to say a word to God in prayer.</p>
		  	<p>Situations even less than these propel people to speak against God, with all manner of curses... Situations like these, prompt people to commit suicide, even at a young age </p>
		  	<p>Not many would have endured up to 12 years with such a shame of blood. A large percentage of the world today may have acted suicidal towards such predicaments. How will the lives of these fellows have ended if they had given up to suicide?</p>
		  	<p>There was a latter glory after the plague . . . Indeed, there is always a light after the tunnel. Jabez and the woman had to wait years before things turned around. Likewise, all God requires of us is a bit of patience and endurance.</p>
		  	<p>If the woman with the issue of blood had given up in the 11th year, she never would have known how close she was to her healing. Beloved, you are closer than you think; don’t give up!</p>
		  	<p>Just like these fellows, many of us have lived almost all our lives in a specific plague. We may have struggled, and been entangled by a certain predicament. Just the same way they broke off the plague in courage, we also, must not be too depressed, discouraged or weighed down to act.</p>
		  	<p>When the duo felt that they had endured enough, they acted! Jabez was just a prayer away from his breakthrough. The woman was just a push away from her breakthrough. Beloved, you are just one action away. Don’t be too discouraged to act.</p>
		  	<p>You have endured enough of that plague, It is time to break off it. Don’t be discouraged, don’t be weighed down, and don’t be depressed; suicide is not the answer. It’s just a single push to your breakthrough. Be blessed!</p>
