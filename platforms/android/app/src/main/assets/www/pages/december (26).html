		  <div class="panel-body" style="text-align:justify">


		  	<p><i>And Jesus came and said to them, “All authority in heaven and on earth has been given to me. Go therefore and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit, (Matthew 28:18-19 ESV)</i></p>
		  

		  	<blockquote>A lot of Christians perish because they lack an understanding of the magnitude of Authority, which we have in Christ.</blockquote>

		  	<p>Jesus declared to His disciples, that he had all authority in heaven and on earth. The amazing aspect of this scripture is that He released us with the same measure of authority. He did not reduce it!</p>
		  	<p>All authority means authority over everything. In essence, there is nothing, which we do not have authority over. We have all authority! Not just in heaven, but on the earth as well.</p>
		  	<p>A lot of people tend to believe that our authority as Christians can only be exercised when we get to heaven. That’s why you hear them say so ignorantly, “when we get to heaven, the angels will be at our command”, beloved, the angels are already at our command. We have all authority in heaven and earth!</p>
		  	<p>So often, people sing, “When we get to heaven; no more heartbreaking, no more sorrows, victory alas!” Do we really need to get to heaven for sorrows and heartbreaking to cease? Should our victory be delayed till the last assembly in heaven? We have been given all authority in heaven and earth already.</p>
		  	<p>There is no limit to the authority we have as Sons of God. Not only do we have authority in heaven (over angels and spiritual beings), we also have authority on earth.</p>
		  	<p>Why should we be limited by the system of the world, its rules and principles?</p>
		  	<p>A lot of Christians perish because they lack an understanding of the magnitude of Authority, which we have in Christ.</p>
		  	<p>You should not be defined by the system of the world; the world should be defined by your standards. You should not be limited by the principles and rules of the world; the world should play by your rules. Until you understand your Authority in Christ, you will constantly be subject to the world.</p>
		  	<p>Beloved, we have been made to reign in life; sickness cannot limit us, poverty cannot limit us, we cannot fail, we can never be disadvantaged in life. We have all authority, and not some; our authority covers every aspect!</p>
		  	<p>Stop operating from the realm of fear, insecurity, inferiority and limitations; operate from the realm of supernatural authority, and you shall produce great results. Be blessed!</p>
