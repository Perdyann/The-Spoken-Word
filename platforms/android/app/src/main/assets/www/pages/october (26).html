		  	<p><i>[They will be] treacherous [betrayers], rash, [and] inflated with self-conceit. [They will be] lovers of sensual pleasures and vain amusements more than and rather than lovers of God. (2 Timothy 3:4 AMP)</i></p>
		  	

		  	<blockquote>If you have not made any divine impact in the earth, then you have not lived, but merely existed. </blockquote>

		  	<p>Paul, in his letter to Timothy, revealed a hint of what it will be like in the last days. He made mention of all manner of evil, which the heart of man will embrace in the last days.</p>
		  	<p>Men will be selfish, proud, blasphemers, disobedient, unthankful, unholy, fierce, traitors, and finally lovers of pleasures more than lovers of God.</p>
		  	<p>As I meditated on the list, this particular phrase caught my attention—Lovers of pleasure more than lovers of God—I am now convinced beyond any doubt, that we are in the last days.</p>
		  	<p>The evil which Paul spoke about has become so prominent over recent years; people are more interested in gratifying and satisfying their sensual pleasures, than fulfilling their Divine Purpose.</p>
		  	<p>The focus of men has drifted from God, to worldly pleasures. People are more led by their senses and feelings, than they are led by the Spirit of God. People are so quick to respond to the need of their flesh, than they are to respond to the call of God.</p>
		  	<p>One thing they fail to realize is that the pleasures last, but for a temporal moment, but Divine things are eternal. A man, who is indulgently carried away by the pleasures of the world, will pass away with it, in no time.</p>
		  	<p>Gratifying your pleasures will not save you, but fulfilling the purpose, for which you were sent.</p>
		  	<p>More than Jesus desired to satisfy His belly with meat and wine; He focused on fulfilling His purpose. Little wonder it is written,</p>
		  	<p><i>“Jesus said to them, My food (nourishment) is to do the will (pleasure) of Him Who sent Me and to accomplish and completely finish His work (John 4:34 AMP).</i></p>
		  	<p>The only pleasure He had was in accomplishing the work of God. Beloved, our primary assignment is doing the work of God, and not seeking to satisfy ourselves with sensual pleasures and vain amusements.</p>
		  	<p>If Jesus was to come today; if the Lord was to call us home today; what account can we give of His Work, which we were sent to fulfil? What account can we give of all the number of years (time) we have lived on earth?</p>
		  	<p>If you have not made any divine impact in the earth, then you have not lived, but merely existed.</p>
		  	<p>It is very erroneous to love pleasures more than you love God, and this is how you know it—If you spend more time on vain amusements than you spend in the presence of God, then you are a lover of pleasure more than God.</p>
		  	<p>It is crazy how people pass the whole night in a club (many hours), but can hardly spend an hour in prayers . . . such people say, “It is not about the length of time you pray but its effectiveness” Self deceit!</p>
		  	<p>So many things happen in the spirit realm, if you are not sold out in spirit, and constantly soaked in the presence of God, you will easily be made a prey. Die to worldly pleasures, and live in the will (pleasure) of God. Be blessed!</p>
