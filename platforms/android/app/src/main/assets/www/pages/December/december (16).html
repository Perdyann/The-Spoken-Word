		  	<p><i>Then he said, Take the arrows. And he took them. And he said to the king of Israel, Strike on the ground. And he struck three times and stopped.</i></p>
		  	<p><i>And the man of God was angry with him and said, You should have struck five or six times; then you would have struck down Syria until you had destroyed it. But now you shall strike Syria down only three times. (2 Kings 13:18-19 AMP)</i></p>
		  	
		  	<blockquote>One of the greatest mistakes is to quit when you are at the verge of victory.</blockquote>

		  	<p>When Elisha was about to die, he gave the King of Israel, Jehoash, the opportunity of a lifetime. He was given a bow and an arrow, and asked to shoot, he shot as instructed; Elisha then asked him to strike the ground with the arrows of victory.</p>
		  	<p>Jehoash struck the ground three times and stopped! That was his mistake! One of the greatest mistakes is to quit when you are at the verge of victory. Elisha expected him to keep striking until he was sure of the Syrians defeat, but because he struck only three times, he obtained just partial victory.</p>
		  	<p>Because he struck three times, he defeated the Syrians only three times — partial victory!</p>
		  	<p>Partial victory is no victory at all; there’s no point defeating an opponent today, who will defeat you tomorrow. I bet we all want to have the last laugh; that was not the case of Jehoash.</p>
		  	<p>When you are given a Divine instruction, carry it out till the end; when you run a race, cross the finish-line; when you have a task, accomplish it. Don’t quit that Divine instruction, which you have started already. Denounce partial victory!</p>
		  	<p>If the ground is worth striking, it is worth striking till the end. Don’t strike once, twice or thrice and stop; keep striking until something happens.</p>
		  	<p>What Elisha did for the King was to give him the bow and arrow of victory, with a Divine command to strike. He laid the foundation of victory, but the rest was in the hand of the King. He had the opportunity to use the arrow to determine the extent of his victory!</p>
		  	<p>In the same way, we have been equipped by God, and endowed with all we need for our lifetime. The extent of victory is determined by how well we make use of our equipments.</p>
		  	<p>God has given us the Word and the Spirit to lead us, as long as we abide in the Word, our victory remains certain; a Christian only begins to derail when he intentionally disconnects from the Word and the Spirit.</p>
		  	<p>Elisha said to the King, if he will strike, then shall he be victorious over the Syrians; God has said to us, if we confess and meditate on His Word day and night, He shall make us successful, and our ways prosperous (Joshua 1:8).</p>
		  	<p>If your victory lies in how well you strike the ground, strike it until something happens; if your success is connected to meditating on God’s Word day and night, don’t stop meditating.</p>
		  	<p>The ball is in your court to roll; will you start striking and quit? Don’t go for partial victory, carry on till the very end. Be blessed!</p>
