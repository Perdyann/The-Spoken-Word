		  	<h5><strong>THE QUALITIES OF LOVE</strong></h5>
		  

		  	<p><i>So now faith, hope, and love abide, these three; but the greatest of these is love. (1 Corinthians 13:13) ESV</i></p>
		  	

		  	<blockquote>Lack of love brings to a nullity the greatest achievement and quality of any man. </blockquote>

		  	<p>As great as we may have understood faith to be, there is indeed something greater. The greatness of faith, hope and love are well emphasised here, but above all these, love is outstandingly spelt out as the greatest of all.</p>
		  	<p>The qualities of faith and hope are encompassed in love. The more we get to understand love in its magnitude, the more the qualities of faith and hope are reflected. Love comprises many great qualities; discovering these qualities and applying them, positions you to be great... For there is nothing greater than love, no, not even faith!</p>
		  	<p>The prayer of love heals, soothes and acts even more than that of faith. The study of faith reveals its greatness and importance in the life of any believer. In fact, without faith, it is impossible to please God. However, even when there is faith, but love is lacking, your service is void. Paul clearly states:</p>
		  	<p><i>... and if I have [sufficient] faith so that I can remove mountains, but have not love (God’s love in me) I am nothing (a useless nobody). (1 Corinthians 13:2) AMP</i></p>
		  	<p>A useless nobody! Lack of love brings to a nullity the greatest achievement and quality of any man. You could be the most renowned Prophet, the most accurate speaker, the most faithful man, the most generous person . . . But when love is lacking, your efforts are nullified.</p>
		  	<p>Speaking further, Paul began to elaborate the qualities of love. There are two aspects of love . . . What love is, and what love is not. There are characters we display on a daily basis that clearly defines what love is not.</p>
		  	<h5><strong>WHAT LOVE IS NOT</strong></h5>
		  	<table>
		  		<tr>
		  			<td>Love is not envious/Jealous</td>
		  			<td>Proverbs 23:17 admonishes us above all else not to be envious. Don’t desire to be something that you are not. We all have different purposes and callings; the greatest limitation of man is imitation. As a result of envy and jealousy, many have swayed from their Divine call, and are now living the counterfeit of their original lives.<br/><br/></td>
		  		</tr>
		  		<tr>
		  			<td>Love is not Vainglorious</td>
		  			<td>It’s appalling the way men compromise their stands in pursuit of self-glory, they chase after perishable titles, and material. Excessive pride and dire need of fame, has thwarted the destinies of many men.<br/><br/></td>
		  		</tr>
		  		<tr>
		  			<td>Love does not keep evil records</td>
		  			<td>If there’s one document that should be burnt up today, it is the document that bears a record of all past and hurtful experiences. Until you close the chapter of hurt, the next phase of glory cannot be opened. Quit malice, quit grudges, and free your mind!<br/><br/></td>
		  		</tr>
		  	</table>

		  	<p>These particular actions are the very things that denounce love, indeed, you can never get to live original, until you clear all evil records and embrace love.</p>
		  	<h5><strong>WHAT LOVE IS</strong></h5>
		  	<table>
		  		<tr>
		  			<td>Patient</td>
		  			<td>Love bears all things (vs.7), love is enduring enough . . . It is willing to suffer long. We often hear couples speak about their partners in troubled times saying, “I can’t bear this anymore . . .” We must understand that the very moment that statement is made; love is denounced, because love bears all things unconditionally. If it is really love, it should be patient enough to bear the most adverse challenge.<br/><br/></td>
		  		</tr>
		  		<tr>
		  			<td>Hopeful</td>
		  			<td>Love hopes all things (Vs.7); I am not surprised that in vs. 13, love is clearly pronounced to be greater than hope. Indeed, love encompasses hope. If it is love, it doesn’t look at the present situations, but believes and is hopeful for a better future. Love does not deny a man because of his present stand, but looks at him with the eyes of his future.<br/><br/></td>
		  		</tr>
		  		<tr>
		  			<td>Kind</td>
		  			<td>Love is kind enough not to rejoice at wrong, but in the right things. Love always wants the best! If I really love you, then I should desire the best for you. I should mourn with you, and rejoice with you, sharing your joy and pain.<br/><br/></td>
		  		</tr>
		  		<tr>
		  			<td>Submissive</td>
		  			<td>Love is submissive enough not to insist on its own ways. (1 Corinthians 13:5) It is not self-seeking! It is attentive enough, to listen to the cares of another. Love is selfless!<br/><br/></td>
		  		</tr>
		  		<tr>
		  			<td>Sacrificial</td>
		  			<td>It is love that led God to sacrifice His only Son. Jesus gave up his life for love... If it is love, then it should portray some form of sacrifice!<br/><br/></td>
		  		</tr>

		  	<p>Beloved, notice that Paul was speaking of Spiritual gifts from 1 Corinthians 12, and then he paused to speak of something greater in Chapter 13, before he continued the teachings of spiritual gifts in verse 14. Love is greater than spiritual gifts.</p>
		  	<p>Prophecy, healing and Knowledge all ends in the earth, but love endures forever. There is no sick person to heal in heaven... There is no one that needs prophecy in heaven . . . All these end with the earth. But love is overly shown even on the other side.</p>
		  	<p>Today, spare a moment to meditate on each quality of love, consider the ones lacking in your life, and deliberately act upon it. Decide to love unconditionally... Say this, “I have God’s love in me... There is no one I cannot love!”</p>
