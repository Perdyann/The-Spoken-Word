		  	<p><i>Looking unto Jesus the author and finisher of our faith; who for the joy that was set before him endured the cross, despising the shame, and is set down at the right hand of the throne of God. (Hebrews 12:2)</i></p>
		  	

		  	<blockquote>Before you dare to climb a single stair, you should have a Divine vision of the entire staircase.</blockquote>

		  	<p>Without a foresight of your destiny, you can never really be propelled to get there. What strengthened Jesus to keep moving, enduring the cross and despising the shame was a foresight of the glory that was set before Him.</p>
		  	<p>He had a clear picture of where He was headed to. Verily, when you have a clear picture of destiny, you will know what to endure, what to despise and the direction to go.</p>
		  	<p>Joseph was a man of vision; right from the time he was still in his Father’s house, he already had a clear picture of his destiny. At that point, he might not have understood in details how events will gradually unfold, but what mattered most was the fact that he knew where he was going.</p>
		  	<p>He knew that he was called to rule and reign, but he might not have understood how he will get to that place.</p>
		  	<p>Likewise brethren, it is important that in everything, you know where you are going to . . . it is important for you to start now to visualize your destiny; it is alright if you don’t know in details how it will happen; as long as you have seen the end, nothing can stop you from getting there</p>
		  	<p>Never start a journey without direction; don’t join a train without knowing its final destination.</p>
		  	<p>Don’t get into a relationship without a vision of its destiny. Don’t get married without knowing where you’re headed to. Don’t start a business without a clear picture of where it is leading to </p>
		  	<p>An understanding of where you are going to, will help you get there with ease. Before you think of starting up a business, you should have asked yourself, “Where do I see this business in the next decade? Before you think of getting married, you should have thought, “Where do I see this; if you don’t have a vision; then you are better off without a spouse, business or any major project. Before you dare to climb a single stair, you should have a Divine vision of the entire staircase.</p>
		  	<p>If you can capture the entire staircase with your eyes of faith, nothing stops you from being above it. Likewise, if you can capture your destiny with your eyes of faith, nothing stops you from fulfilling it.</p>
		  	<p>The current situation of things around you might not be so encouraging, but as long as you know where you are going, you are alright.</p>
		  	<p>An understanding of where you are going to will keep you from being trapped by the stumbling blocks on the way. Joseph knew exactly where he was headed, so much that he could not be trapped by the grip of Potiphar’s wife.</p>
		  	<p>Where you are going matters much more than where you have been; rather than revisiting previous chapters of your life, have a clear picture of the subsequent chapters, and get ready for them.</p>
		  	<p>Get rid of the company, habit and information that does not represent where you are going; if it cannot fit into your destiny, it is not worth clinging unto now. Be blessed!</p>
