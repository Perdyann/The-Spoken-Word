		  	<h5><strong>FAITH: The response of the Human Spirit to the Word of God</strong></h5>

		  	<p><i>And he entered into one of the ships, which was Simon’s, and prayed him that he would thrust out a little from the land. And he sat down, and taught the people out of the ship.</i></p>
		  	<p><i>Now when he had left speaking, he said unto Simon, Launch out into the deep, and let down your nets for a draught.</i></p>
		  	<p><i>And Simon answering said unto him, Master, we have toiled all the night, and have taken nothing: <b>nevertheless at thy word I will let down the net.</b></i></p>
		  	<p><i>And when they had this done, they inclosed a great multitude of fishes: and their net brake. (Luke 5:3-6)</i></p>
		  	


		  	<blockquote>Until you get to the juncture of relying absolutely on the Word of God, your glory remains caged.</blockquote>

		  	<p>Ordinarily, the response of a layman to that instruction would have been, “you don’t get it . . . there’s no fish in this river.” Indeed, to a man with such pessimism, there can never be any outcome.</p>
		  	<p>Faith is the response of the Human Spirit to the Word of God. In a season, when Simon had toiled tirelessly, to get a fish at least, but received nothing; the Word of the Lord came, and changed everything. Night spiritually represents a season of retirement. In essence, Simon had toiled, and was at the verge of giving up, when the Word of the Lord came.</p>
		  	<p>Don’t give up when things don’t respond positively despite your struggle to make it right . . . Sometimes, the breakthrough is just waiting for the last hour, to be manifest.</p>
		  	<p>I’ve noticed that things delayed till the latter seasons are always more valuable. If Simon had gotten a fish when he initially toiled, it may have been in a normal quantity, or perhaps, a little bit insufficient. But when it was manifested at the latter hour, it yielded an overflow, such that their nets and boats could not contain.</p>
		  	<p>Sometimes, God needs us to abide in that place of fishing with faith. Furthermore, we must understand that what we need is the Word of God. It is the Word of God that charges up our faith to yield the overflow.</p>
		  	<p>In the Ministry of Jesus, observe how He healed people... Just by His Words... He would say, “Take up your pallet and walk” the crippled man may believe, but he acts faith when he lets his human spirit to respond to God’s Word by standing. If the crippled had replied, “Can’t you see that I can’t walk?” he never would have walked.</p>
		  	<p>So many people have been crying to God for a miracle, but we must get to understand that God does not respond to our tears, but our faith. It is not the tears that provoke God to act, but faith.</p>
		  	<p>God has sent His Word; all we are required to do is to respond in faith. The water Simon fished in represents our ministry, businesses, and career... and the fishes represent the outcome.</p>
		  	<p>Receive this Word, you may have toiled for many years in your businesses and ministry, but there’s really no positive outcome. God’s saying that you should let down your net again... Respond in faith. Someone needs to tell God today, “it’s not been easy getting my desired outcome, nevertheless, at your Word, I’d let me another chance.”</p>
		  	<p>Until you get to the juncture of relying absolutely on the Word of God, your glory remains caged. What propelled Simon Peter to let his net down again is not just a fair chance, but the conviction of God’s Word.</p>
		  	<p>Today, activate your faith, by responding to the Word of God. Therein lays your breakthrough and overflow. Be blessed!</p>
