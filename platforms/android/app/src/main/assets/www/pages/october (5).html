		  	<p><i>And he lighted upon a certain place, and tarried there all night, because the sun was set; and he took of the stones of that place, and put them for his pillows, and lay down in that place to sleep.</i></p>
		  	<p><i>And, behold, the LORD stood above it, and said, I am the LORD God of Abraham thy father, and the God of Isaac: the land whereon thou liest, to thee will I give it, and to thy seed; (Genesis 28:11 & 13)</i></p>

		  	<blockquote>Even in the most hopeless places, God can bring forth an unexpected miracle.</blockquote>

		  	<p>After Jacob had departed from Beersheba, he journeyed towards Haran. There was a certain place, where he had to spend the night in, because the sun was already set.</p>
		  	<p>That land, where he tarried was not his comfort zone; it was a place characterized by its level of malaise and incommode. This was to the extent that the only pillows Jacob could lay his head on were stones.</p>
		  	<p>Have you ever been through such hardness where stones were the only pillows you had?</p>
		  	<p>I recall several instances of sleeping on hard pillows; this only resulted in neck-pain and nightmares. If a genuine pillow that was merely hard could result in neck-pain, how much more pain would you feel when your head is laid upon real stones?</p>
		  	<p>This defines the level of inconvenience Jacob had to tolerate for the night; in such a place where hardness was portrayed in every way, blessings were birthed.</p>
		  	<p>Rather than having nightmares, as I would have anticipated, Jacob saw a great vision in his sleep. It was in that same hard place that God began to spell out blessings upon him and his seed.</p>
		  	<p>In that same hard place, God released the blessing of possession, multiplication and preservation. Isnâ€™t it amazing how God releases blessings out of the places we least expect?</p>
		  	<p>Of all places God could bless Jacob in, He chose a hard place; of all places God could take Ezekiel to, He chose the valley of dry bones. Of all places God chose to raise Lazarus from, it was the tomb.</p>
		  	<p>Jesus could have healed Lazarus while he was sick, but He tarried till he had rested in the tomb for days; the Spirit of God could have led Ezekiel to a hospital to heal the sick, but he led him to valley of dry bones to give life to that, which was already considered hopeless.</p>
		  	<p>Even in the most hopeless places, God can bring forth an unexpected miracle. No matter how inconvenient and uncomfortable the place, where you are seems; no matter how hopeless the situation seems; always bear in mind that there is no place too hard or hopeless for a miracle to occur.</p>
		  	<p>Trust God in your situation; even when the only pillows you can find is the stones, still trust God for a blessed vision. The place might be hard to dwell in, but it is not too hard to contain a blessing. Be blessed!</p>
