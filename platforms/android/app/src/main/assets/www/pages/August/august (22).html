		  	<p><i>Simon Peter saith unto them, I go a fishing. They say unto him, We also go with thee. They went forth, and entered into a ship immediately; and that night they caught nothing.</i></p>
		  	<p><i>But when the morning was now come, Jesus stood on the shore: but the disciples knew not that it was Jesus.</i></p>
		  	<p><i>And he said unto them, Cast the net on the right side of the ship, and ye shall find. They cast therefore, and now they were not able to draw it for the multitude of fishes. (John 21:3-4&6)</i></p>

		  	<blockquote>When you understand that the morning comes with multiplication, you’d gladly wait for it.</blockquote>

		  	<p>This scripture passage portrays two contrasting events that occurred in two different seasons—the night season, and the morning season.</p>
		  	<p><i>... and that night they caught nothing. </i> The night is a season of endless toil, yielding no results. It is a season of sorrows and pains, without any reasonable gain.</p>
		  	<p>The disciples did combine their different fishing skills, efforts and time, to no avail. That night, despite all they invested, they caught nothing. But something significant happened afterwards.</p>
		  	<p>When the morning was come. Beloved, the story changed when morning approached. They labored like elephants, but reaped like ants all through the night; however, in the morning they produced sweatless results.</p>
		  	<p>All that they were denied in the night became excessive in the morning. Pains could have endured for the night, but the morning came with renewed joy.</p>
		  	<p>I feel it so strong in my spirit to let someone know today, that the morning has arrived, to release all that we were denied in our night season. It is written;</p>
		  	<p><i> ... weeping may endure for a night, but joy cometh in the morning. (Psalms 30:5b)</i></p>
		  	<p>No matter how dark a night gets, the day will surely break in brightness; no matter how long the night seems, the morning will surely come; no matter how much the night causes us to weep, the morning will surely break forth with joy.</p>
		  	<p>You might be going through series of trials, pressure, pain and toil; it might seem like your night season is never going to come to an end; cheer up beloved, the darker the night gets, the closer it is to morning.</p>
		  	<p>Beloved, what Simon toiled for in the night was just a few fish, but what he got in the morning was a multitude of net-breaking fishes. If I was Simon, I’d probably be glad that the blessing tarried through the night, and multiplied by morning.</p>
		  	<p>Verily, the blessing of the morning overshadows the toil of the night; you will get in multiple folds, that which you have been denied in your night season. It will be to an extent that you’d have to thank God for the initial delay.</p>
		  	<p>If you have an idea how close you are to your morning, you wouldn’t be bothered about the challenges of the night. When you understand that the morning comes with multiplication, you’d gladly wait for it.</p>
		  	<p>The night might have brought pain, sorrows, and stress; but the morning ushers in joy, blessings and fulfillment. Though the night tarries, the morning will surely come. Greater is coming!</p>
