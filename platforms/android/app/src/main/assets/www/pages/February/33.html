		  	<p><i>Jesus said unto him, If thou canst believe, all things are possible to him that believeth. (Mark 9:23)</i></p>
		  	


		  	<blockquote>Believing is what activates the possibility of anything in life... It is the supernatural tool that is used to usher in a ray of hope in the most hopeless situation. </blockquote>

		  	<p>There are certain things in life which we’ve given up on, and tagged to be impossible. Some of these things, we genuinely hoped were possible, but we’ve accepted the limit nature places on the life of any man.</p>
		  	<p>So often, we wish some things were evitable, but they just aren’t. Sickness may have had a grip on your loved one, and you sincerely wish it is possible to just get rid of all ailments, but some ailments seem tougher than we expect. Well, here’s some good news . . . ALL THINGS ARE INDEED POSSIBLE! O yea, it’s possible for Cancer, Aids, and other deadly ailments to leave your system.</p>
		  	<p>There is only but one criterion to having all things become a possibility to you . . . Just believe! Believing is what activates the possibility of anything in life. Have you taken time to observe the first question Jesus usually asked before He healed anyone?</p>
		  	<p><i>When He reached the house and went in, the blind men came to Him, and Jesus said to them, Do you believe that I am able to do this? They said to Him, Yes, Lord. (Matthew 9:28)</i></p>
		  	<p>Jesus often asks, ‘Do you believe’ the reason is because, there is no operation carried out in unbelief that is successful. Your healing, breakthrough and miracle emanates from your deliberate decision to believe. Believing is the supernatural tool that is used to usher in a ray of hope in the most hopeless situation.</p>
		  	<p>Furthermore, we are made to understand that Jesus did not perform so many miracles in his home town because the familiarity his background had with Him, served as a major hindrance to them believing him. Verily, there is no greater hindrance to your release than disbelief.</p>
		  	<p>In order to have anything possible in your life, you have to start by believing. Believing is the first step to receiving. There is hardly anyone that was able to receive from the ministry of Jesus without believing.—You can never partake from the blessings of any ministry that you don’t believe in.</p>
		  	<p>Beloved, what situation are you going through in life . . . ? Is there anything you hope to achieve? Is there anything you hope to receive at any given time? The key to commence activating all these is to believe. Do you want to get healed? Believe! Do you need a breakthrough? Believe!</p>
		  	<p>The most successful people I have met in life are people who once believed that they could make it, and as a result, dared to take a step of faith. Indeed, they are great today because they once believed it. Beloved, whatever it is you want to achieve; only believe! Be blessed!</p>
