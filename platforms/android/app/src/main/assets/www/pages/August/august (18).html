		  	<p><i>Give us this day our daily bread. (Matthew 6:11)</i></p>

		  	<blockquote>There is a measure of virtue made available in every season. A premature release of the wrong measure will lead to demotion rather than increase.</blockquote>

		  	<p>So often, I read through this line of the Lord’s Prayer, but never received an insight from it, until I meditated intently between the lines. This particular line of Jesus is very revelatory; it proves God’s sufficient provision for our daily needs.</p>
		  	<p>Initially I wondered why Jesus taught them to pray only for the present day, using the term, ‘this day’, He could have said, “Give us the bread we need for this day, and the days to come” No! He only spoke about the provision of the present day. As I pondered on this, I realized that God’s mercies, faithfulness, provision and love towards us are renewed daily.</p>
		  	<p>Indeed, a day has enough worries for itself. No man has all he needs to sustain him for his entire life-time, but as long as we have the Holy Spirit, our future is secured.</p>
		  	<p>In essence, you don’t need to worry about the bills you might need to pay next year; you don’t need to worry about how you will be sustained tomorrow; you don’t need to worry about the burdens of tomorrow, while today is not yet spent.</p>
		  	<p>God releases to us every day, month and year. In every season, there is a release to cater for your needs through that time, don’t be bothered about the seasons to come. When that season approaches, there will be a new release for it.</p>
		  	<p>The bread for the Sons of God, are given on a daily basis; tomorrow’s bread will be made available when tomorrow comes. In the meantime, be joyous, for this day’s hunger has been satisfied.</p>
		  	<p>Some resources are only made available when the season for its use arrives. To think of it, will a Father give his child the food meant for a year in a single day? It will surely perish before then.</p>
		  	<p>Likewise, there is timing for every spiritual release; the bread we need is provided on a daily basis.</p>
		  	<p>When the prodigal son was given a portion of his father’s wealth prematurely, he couldn’t utilize it properly. As a result, he was demoted from being the son of a wealthy man, to a carer of pigs.</p>
		  	<p>In the same sense, there is a measure of virtue made available in every season. A premature release of the wrong measure will lead to demotion rather than increase.</p>
		  	<p>Here’s the point beloved, you don’t need to worry about the future; God, who has given you bread for today, will never let you starve tomorrow. He will never lead you to a realm where His mercies cannot sustain you. His mercies are new every morning, and His provisions renewed every season. Be blessed!</p>
