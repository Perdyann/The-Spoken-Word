		  	<p><i>And Jesus, walking by the sea of Galilee, saw two brethren, Simon called Peter, and Andrew his brother, casting a net into the sea: for they were fishers.</i></p>
		  	<p><i>And he saith unto them, Follow me, and I will make you fishers of men.</i></p>
		  	<p><i>And they straightway left their nets, and followed him.</i></p>
		  	<p><i>And going on from thence, he saw other two brethren, James the son of Zebedee, and John his brother, in a ship with Zebedee their father, mending their nets; and he called them.</i></p>
		  	<p><i>And they immediately left the ship and their father, and followed him. (Matthew 4:18-22)</i></p>


		  	<blockquote>No matter how successful a man is, if he is not led by the Spirit, but by his self-will, he remains vulnerable. </blockquote>

		  	<p>Growing up, I had a passion and desire to venture into a lot of fields. I wanted to do almost everything that someone had done. Getting into the entertainment industry was one of my big plans, which I worked towards achieving. However, during the course of preparation, God called me for something else. This led me to abandon my own plan for my life, and embrace God’s plan.</p>
		  	<p>That is a decision I can never regret!</p>
		  	<p>We all have desires... we all have wants... we all have dreams and visions... we all have our self-will... However, it is important to prioritize the will of God above anything else. For it is He who has the best plan for our lives.</p>
		  	<p>As men, our knowledge is limited. There are some things that no matter how hard we try, we just cannot know them; only God knows! We really don’t know our last day yet. So it is important to submit to God who knows all things, and who alone declares the end from the beginning. (Isaiah 46:10)</p>
		  	<p>Simon Peter, Andrew, James and John, were pretty much busy, and occupied with their various chores. However, when Jesus called them, they whole-heartedly and instantly abandoned their personal duties, ambitions, dreams and occupations to follow the Master.</p>
		  	<p>Serving God requires living for Him, above yourself. It entails absolute submission. Above all, it entails dying to yourself, and denying your own self-will, to accept God’s perfect will for our lives.</p>
		  	<p>When Jesus called his disciples, they were in their places of duty... They were not idle. Therefore, to be used by God, it is important that you are diligently working.</p>
		  	<p>If you are a man who is so much in love with your own will and plan, you will hardly be able to hearken to God’s ideal plan, and so, you may end up living a misplaced life. If you have not denied yourself, your family and friends, then you are not ready for service yet. Paul said,</p>
		  	<p><i>“I protest by your rejoicing which I have in Christ Jesus our Lord, I die daily” (1 Corinthians 15:31).</i></p>
		  	<p>Are you ready to die daily? So many times, what prompts our decision is not the Holy Spirit, but what we feel is right. We prefer to reason, and walk by our self will... But consider Jesus: when He was about to be given up, as much as he wanted the cup to pass Him by, He gave priority to God’s own will. (Matthew 26:39)</p>
		  	<p>It is written, <i> “I have been crucified with Christ. It is no longer I who live, but Christ who lives in me.” (Galatians 2:20) ESV</i></p>
		  	<p>The life we live now, is God’s life lived through us. We are not the ones who live. We live in God. My decisions are no longer mine, but that of the Spirit of God. Refuse to live for yourself!</p>
		  	<p>Don’t be in Ministry for your own gain. Never let your reason for doing anything to be self-glorification and self—benefit. Work heartily and selflessly as unto the Lord and not man. (Colossians 3:23)</p>
		  	<p>Consider this; when you are given an invitation to Minister at a conference, what prompts your response? Do you go because it seems like an opportunity to get famous? Or do you accept or reject it because the Holy Spirit has told you to?</p>
		  	<p>No matter how successful a man is, if he is not led by the Spirit, but by his self-will, he remains vulnerable. Stop operating by your self-will, embrace revelation!</p>
