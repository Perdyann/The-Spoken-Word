		  	<p><i>For even though by this time you ought to be teaching others, you actually need someone to teach you over again the very first principles of God’s Word. You have come to need milk, not solid food. (Hebrews 5:12)</i></p>
		 

		  	<blockquote>For every assignment God gives, and every Word He speaks, there is a time affixed. We should weigh every Word and assignment in accordance with that time. </blockquote>

		  	<p>It is important that we, in all seasons, understand our current stand, and the position we should be occupying. Sometimes, our current stand contrasts our rightful position.</p>
		  	<p>In this letter to the Hebrews, it is clearly stated that people, who currently, should be teachers, are in need of teachers; people, who should be in charge of affairs, are in need of someone to take charge over them. This clearly implies that where they are, is not where they ought to be.</p>
		  	<p>There is a conviction propelled by the reason of this scripture, which makes us to wonder, “Am I where I ought to be?”</p>
		  	<p>Many years have come and gone; we have grown physically and mentally over the years; but are we where we ought to be spiritually? It’s been years since we gave our lives to Christ, but what can we give account of in all these years?</p>
		  	<p>Where should my Ministry be at this time? Where should I be at this time? Until these questions are addressed, you might comfortably remain relaxed in a position you should have graduated from ages ago.</p>
		  	<p>An infant feeds on milk throughout the season of his infancy, but when that baby graduates from the stage of infancy, and still feeds of milk, it’s no longer proper.</p>
		  	<p>The time has come when we should ask, “Is this the food I should be feeding on at this time and stage of my life?” There is a wake-up call for the Sons of God today, for many sons are still living like babes.</p>
		  	<p>God will never let you wander in the wrong place for too long; He will never let you tread on a derailed path for too long; He will always convict you just in time. Now is the time to review your position and know where you stand.</p>
		  	<p>For every assignment God gives, and every Word He speaks, there is a time affixed. We should weigh every Word and assignment in accordance with that time.</p>
		  	<p>It’s alright for your working hours to be extended, but is that what God requires of you at this season and time? It is not enough to do the right things, but to be sure that they are done at the right time.</p>
		  	<p>I know that I am not where I ought to be at this time, but all hope is not lost yet. It is never too late to rise up and occupy my rightful position.</p>
		  	<p>May the grace of God that surpasses all understanding, grant us the strength we need to catapult us to that realm where we ought to operate from at this time, In Jesus Name, Amen. Be blessed!</p>
