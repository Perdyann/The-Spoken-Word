		  	<p><i>And it came to pass, when they were gone over, that Elijah said unto Elisha, Ask what I shall do for thee, before I be taken away from thee. And Elisha said, I pray thee, let a double portion of thy spirit be upon me.</i></p>
		  	<p><i>And he said, Thou hast asked a hard thing: nevertheless, if thou see me when I am taken from thee, it shall be so unto thee; but if not, it shall not be so.</i></p>
		  	<p><i><b>And Elisha saw it </b> ... (2 Kings 2: 9-10 &12)</i></p>


		  	<blockquote>No man visualizes the bigger picture and remains small . . . What you see, is what you become.</blockquote>

		  	<p>When I read this passage, a particular question lingered in my heart for a while until I discovered the truth. I asked, “Why did Elijah demand that Elisha must have to see him before he could be granted his request?” It could have been anything else, but why sight?</p>
		  	<p>Verily, Elijah knew the power of sight. You can never become anything that you’ve not seen. In order for Elisha to have a double portion of Elijah’s spirit, he had to see his transfiguration.</p>
		  	<p><i>“... we shall be like him; for we shall see him as he is.” (1 John 3:2b)</i></p>
		  	<p>What you see, is what you become . . . Just as seeing God enables us to become like God, seeing Elijah is what enabled Elisha to become like him. As the passage says, ‘And Elisha saw it.’ Beloved, it doesn’t matter what men define you as; what matters is how you see yourself. If you decide today, to see yourself from the eyes of God and not man, the sky will be your starting point. It is written,</p>
		  	<p><i>And we all, with unveiled face, beholding the glory of the Lord, are being transformed into the same image from one degree of glory to another. For this comes from the Lord who is the Spirit. (2 Corinthians 3:18) ESV</i></p>
		  	<p>What you see, is what you are transformed into. There is power in sight, I always say, “what you see matters a lot” If there’s one thing that made Joseph to become the greatest of his brothers, it is sight! Even while he was in subjection, and in the pit, he had the ability to see himself in Authority, and in the Palace. What do you see?</p>
		  	<p><i>For all the land which thou seest, to thee will I give it, and to thy seed for ever. (Genesis 13:15)</i></p>
		  	<p>The power of Sight! You can never possess a heritage that you’ve not seen. Although God had promised Abraham greatness in all spheres, He still required Abraham to see, before he can possess anything. The magnitude of what Abraham could receive was determined by how far he could see. If he was spiritually myopic, he wouldn’t have been the Father of All Nations.</p>
		  	<p>An eagle is known to be the greatest and most powerful bird... It sights its prey from kilometres up high, and alights in force to devour. As powerful as an eagle is, it is nothing without its sight. The strength of an eagle is not in its mighty wings, but its ability to see far. Take away the eyes of an eagle; it sure wouldn’t soar so high again.</p>
		  	<p>There is nothing that defines a person as much as his vision. It is written; “Where there is no vision, the people perish... (Proverbs 29:18) The devil understands this. If there’s one thing he tries to hinder, it is sight.</p>
		  	<p><i>For the god of this world has blinded the unbelievers’ minds [that they should not discern the truth], preventing them from seeing the illuminating light of the Gospel of the glory of Christ (the Messiah), Who is the Image and Likeness of God. (2 Corinthians 4:4) AMP</i></p>
		  	<p>The reason why we preach to unbelievers so often, yet they don’t seem to understand, is because they are blind. The enemy labours to prevent them from seeing, because he knows that their transformation is linked to their ability to see.</p>
		  	<p>When God arrested Saul for 3 days, and wanted to use him, the first thing that happened was that scales fell off his eyes, and his sight was restored. (Acts 9:18) In order for Saul (the persecutor) to be transformed to Paul (the believer), he had to see with a clear eye. Tis nothing but the power of sight.</p>
		  	<p>Joseph was bound, chained, imprisoned, and persecuted. Indeed, they could tie down everything Joseph had, but they couldn’t seize his vision. It is that vision that led him to the Palace.</p>
		  	<p>Beloved, the Doctors may have given you all sorts of depressing reports, but understand this... the doctors’ view from a medical perspective is very limited, but the Word of God is unlimited. It is not what the Doctors see in your system (cancer, fibroid, etc.) that matters, but what you see and believe.</p>
		  	<p>Sharpen your sight in the Word of God. Stop looking at the problems of this day; drift your focus to the promises of tomorrow... Just like Joseph, no man visualizes the bigger picture and remains small. Write down your vision this day, and make it clear (Habakkuk 2:2) Bear in mind always—what you see is what you become. Be blessed!</p>
