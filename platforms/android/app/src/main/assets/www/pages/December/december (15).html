		  	<p><i>That confirmeth the word of his servant, and performeth the counsel of his messengers; that saith to Jerusalem, Thou shalt be inhabited; and to the cities of Judah, Ye shall be built, and I will raise up the decayed places thereof: (Isaiah 44:26)</i></p>
		  

		  	<blockquote>When there is no word, there can’t be any confirmation. God does not confirm our feelings, but our words. </blockquote>

		  	<p>The Lord confirms the words of His servant, and performs the counsel of His messengers. When the servants have spoken no words, and when the messengers have given no counsel, then there is nothing to be confirmed or fulfilled.</p>
		  	<p>In Mark 11:23, we are assured that we shall have whatsoever we say; in essence, when we’ve said nothing, we shall have nothing. Isn’t it obvious that the reason why some expectations are not met yet is because you are yet to speak?</p>
		  	<p>It is your words that the Lord will confirm, it is your counsel that he will fulfill. A speechless Christian is a powerless Christian. A born-again man, who lacks knowledge of how to use his words rightly, in his favor, is still missing out on something great. It is written:</p>
		  	<p><i>Now Elijah the Tishbite, of Tishbe in Gilead, said to Ahab, “As the Lord, the God of Israel, lives, before whom I stand, there shall be neither dew nor rain these years, except by my word.” (1 Kings 17:1)</i></p>
		  	<p>Did you notice that Elijah did not speak according to the Word of God, but his own word? Elijah decreed that the there shall be no dew nor rain, except by his word, and it was so. The Lord confirmed it.</p>
		  	<p>Elijah had to say a word, in order for the Lord to make a confirmation of it. It all sums up to this truth—when there is no word, there can’t be any confirmation.</p>
		  	<p>Beloved, that which you desire the Lord to confirm must be uttered in faith. Without an utterance, don’t expect any confirmation or manifestation. It is not good enough to desire health, speak healing, and the Lord will confirm it.</p>
		  	<p>So many lived their entire lives in penury and destitution simply because they were merely hoping for things to get better, but never spoke in faith. The key to transformation is speaking faith-filled words, which are contrary to your ill situations.</p>
		  	<p>Little wonder it is written in Joel 3:10, <i>“ Let the weak say I am strong.”</i> Even though they actually feel weak, let them speak strength. God does not confirm our feelings, but our words.</p>
		  	<p>So often we sing the song, “let the weak say I am strong, let the poor say I am rich” How true! What God places His signet and stamp on is our words and counsel. Nothing else!</p>
		  	<p>If you can speak the right words, He will confirm it; if you can give the right counsel, He will fulfill it. Be blessed!</p>
