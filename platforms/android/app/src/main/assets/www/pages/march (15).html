		  <div class="panel-body" style="text-align:justify">


		  	<p><i>And at midnight Paul and Silas prayed, and sang praises unto God: and the prisoners heard them.</i></p>
		  	<p><i>And suddenly there was a great earthquake, so that the foundations of the prison were shaken: and immediately all the doors were opened, and every one’s bands were loosed. (Acts 16:25-26)</i></p>

		  	<blockquote>A mere man complains in the prison cell but a Spiritual man praises himself out of every limitation. There is no situation, whose foundation is too strong for praise to break. </blockquote>

		  	<p>After many stripes had been laid on Paul and Silas, and they had been held bound, captive, and limited in a prison, they did not think of anything better to do, than to praise God.</p>
		  	<p>They could have chosen to complain; they could have opted mutiny; they could have blamed God for letting them to be maltreated; amidst all choices they could have made, they chose to praise.</p>
		  	<p>Beloved, there is something about praising God. Great things happen when we praise!</p>
		  	<p>Those who have at least once been held in a place of limitation and captivity will bear witness, that it is often easier to complain than to praise. These particular fellows were in prison for no other reason than doing the will of the Father.</p>
		  	<p>Verily, it can be difficult to praise God outside your comfort zone. Most verily, the key to breaking forth in liberty, to your comfort zone, rests in your ability to praise, even in the prison.</p>
		  	<p>Praise has the ability to shake off, and break un-godly foundations. The prison represents a strongly knitted realm of limitation and captivity. This was such a situation where Paul and Silas were confined. However, by their act of prayer and praise, the foundations of the prison shook, and resulted in an earthquake that ushered in liberty.</p>
		  	<p>Beloved, what should we do if we ever find ourselves in a prison? In a hopeless situation that rips us off the freedom we once had, what should our reaction be? Praise! Beloved, you can choose to praise your way out!</p>
		  	<p>Job was tested and tried! He lost all his possession, family and achievements within a split second, in a single day. What was his reaction to such a trial? Rather than complain, he fell down and worshipped God. He never blamed or cursed God. (Job 1)</p>
		  	<p>Sometimes, losing everything is only a test, to prove how well we can praise God, even in the worst condition. Overcoming such trials will not only yield liberty, but restoration.</p>
		  	<p>By our Divine Nature, liberty is our right. We are above all kinds of captivities and limitations. Just praise!</p>
		  	<p>A mere man complains in the prison cell, because there’s really nothing he can do to change the situation; but a Spiritual man praises himself out of every limitation.</p>
		  	<p>If you are limited in any way; if you are jobless; if you are financially drained; just praise! There is no situation, whose foundation is too strong for praise to break.</p>
		  	<p>Just as every building has a foundation, every problem has its own foundation as well; but I’m yet to meet a foundation that prayer and praise cannot break.</p>
		  	<p>The prison had held many mere men captive for years, but could not handle the prayerful duo for just one night. It is obvious that the secret for instantly breaking through the prison is praise and prayer.</p>
		  	<p>Mere men murmur and complain in the prison; spiritual men praise their way out! Beloved, choose not to complain like an ordinary man, praise your way to your desired realm today. Be blessed!</p>
