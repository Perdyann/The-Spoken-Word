		  	<p><i>Wherefore, if God so clothe the grass of the field, which to day is, and to morrow is cast into the oven, shall he not much more clothe you, O ye of little faith?</i></p>
		  	<p><i>Therefore take no thought, saying, What shall we eat? or, What shall we drink? or, Wherewithal shall we be clothed?</i></p>
		  	<p><i>(For after all these things do the Gentiles seek:) for your heavenly Father knoweth that ye have need of all these things. (Matthew 6:30-32)</i></p>
		


		  	<blockquote>Much more than anything matters to me, it does matter to God, for He owns me.</blockquote>

		  	<p>I was sitting right in my room, in tears. For years, I kept asking myself one question—how?—There are so many things I believed God wanted to do in my life, but at that point, it didn’t seem like I was close to the fulfilment of anything. And I wondered how I will get there</p>
		  	<p>Right in a mess was I caught up, only thinking to myself—how did I get into this, and how do I get out of it? Each day, I was drowned by my anxiety, wondering when and how lines could begin to fall in pleasant places for me.</p>
		  	<p>I was so sure that God had promised transformation, yet, judging by my present situation, I just couldn’t fathom how, and this kept me anxious, until I realised something.</p>
		  	<p>Much more than anything matters to me, it does matter to God, for He owns me. My money is not concerned about spending a night on the street, neither is my drawer. I (the owner) am the one, who is more concerned about having my money in a safe place. Likewise, I realised that we are God’s possessions. More than our safety and comfort matters to us, it does matter to God who owns us. This scripture attests </p>
		  	<p>thus:<i>for your heavenly Father knoweth that ye have need of all these things.</i></p>
		  	<p>God knows what we need much more than we do. If He could care for the grasses and the birds of the air, how much more will He care for us, who He made in his own image? It is written, <i> “... no good thing will he withhold from them that walk uprightly.” (Psalm 84:11) </i> Indeed, anything we don’t have is not good enough for us. If not, it will not be withheld.</p>
		  	<p>Life is full of worries, but worries don’t change situations. I am yet to see a problem that was tackled by worry. We are so full of worries as though we own ourselves. Why worry about your bills when you’ve got a Father? Why worry about what to say, when you’ve got a teacher? God is everything we have and need.</p>
		  	<p><i>But when they deliver you up, take no thought how or what ye shall speak: for it shall be given you in that same hour what ye shall speak. (Matthew 10:19)</i></p>
		  	<p>What we need to say will be given to us in the same hour. Beloved, don’t let delay to lead you to make desperate actions. Be still!</p>
		  	<p>David did not stop at sleeping with Bathsheba; worry prompted him to kill her husband, in order to cover-up his evil. He was worried about his name, reputation, and what people will say, so he killed! That was the beginning of his downfall.</p>
		  	<p>Worry can propel a man to take wrong actions, in order to preserve his value. Never let your actions be prompted by anxiety, but by the Spirit of God. Be blessed!</p>
