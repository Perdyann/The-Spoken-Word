		  	<p><i>Now it came to pass, as they went, that he entered into a certain village: and a certain woman named Martha received him into her house.</i></p>
		  	<p><i>And she had a sister called Mary, which also sat at Jesus’ feet, and heard his word.</i></p>
		  	<p><i>But Martha was cumbered about much serving, and came to him, and said, Lord, dost thou not care that my sister hath left me to serve alone? bid her therefore that she help me.</i></p>
		  	<p><i>And Jesus answered and said unto her, Martha, Martha, thou art careful and troubled about many things:</i></p>
		  	<p><i>But one thing is needful: and Mary hath chosen that good part, which shall not be taken away from her. (Luke 10:38-42)</i></p>


		  	<blockquote>Clinging to the Word despite all odds propels an instant testimony! There is no better place to be located, than in the Word of God. </blockquote>

		  	<p>While Martha was engrossed with so much chores and service, Mary sat at the feet of Jesus, hearing his Word.</p>
		  	<p>In Martha’s perspective, Mary was not doing the right thing at the right time, in as she was needed to help out in the task of serving. However, Jesus had a very variant perspective from hers’, He said, <i> “But one thing is needful:”</i></p>
		  	<p>Verily, Martha’s service was good, but not needful. Just like Martha, we often let ourselves get distracted by unnecessary factors, which we deem important, but are not really as they seem. The only thing we need, at any season is the Word of God.</p>
		  	<p><i>And it came to pass, when Jesus had ended these sayings, the people were astonished at his doctrine: </i></p>
		  	<p>For he taught them as one having authority, and not as the scribes. (Matthew 7:28-29)</p>
		  	<p>There’s not been any teacher that has ever taught with so much power and authority like Jesus did. Having Jesus under your roof, was the best opportunity to be uplifted, edified, comforted and strengthened. Unlike Martha, Mary recognized this opportunity, and took advantage of it. What better place is there, than seating under the counsel of Jesus?</p>
		  	<p>All we need at all times is the Word of God. The Word has the ability to settle and fix all other aspects of our lives. Verily, the height of service Martha could ever render can be nullified by the absence of the Word.</p>
		  	<p><i>“and Mary hath chosen that good part, which shall not be taken away from her.”</i></p>
		  	<p>Mary had a choice to either be in the place of rendering earthly service, or be under the counsel and Word of God. She chose the better place to be—in the Word!</p>
		  	<p><i>“Martha, thou art careful and troubled about many things:”</i></p>
		  	<p>Unlike Mary, Martha was worried about many irrelevant things; these are things that neither edify nor comfort. Beloved, be troubled and worried about nothing; the Word lives! It pays to abide in the Word.</p>
		  	<p>In times of turbulence, take refuge in the Word; in times of uncertainty, seek counsel from the Word; in anxious times, be encouraged in the Word; in times of lack, receive from the Word; in times of dilemma, discern with the Word; in times of challenges, hold on to the Word.</p>
		  	<p>Clinging to the Word despite all odds propels an instant testimony!</p>
		  	<p>There is no problem whatsoever that lacks a Word solution. Beloved, be found in the Word at all times.</p>
		  	<p>Martha had searched for Mary in the place of service, but found her not, until she approached the Word. Beloved, when men look for you everywhere else and find you not, let them locate you in the Word.</p>
		  	<p>When they look for you in your plagues, troubles and challenges, let them find you rather testifying in the Word. There is no better place to be located, than in the Word of God. Be blessed!</p>
