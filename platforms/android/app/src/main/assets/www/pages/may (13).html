		  	<p><i>And when they came that were hired about the eleventh hour, they received every man a penny.</i></p>
		  	<p><i>But when the first came, they supposed that they should have received more; and they likewise received every man a penny. (Matthew 20:9-10)</i></p>

		  	<blockquote>It is not about how long you have been in the vineyard, but how well you have worked in it. Don’t let the passion, zeal and enthusiasm be quenched by mediocrity.</blockquote>

		  	<p>Studying through the parable of the laborers in the vineyard, something very remarkable is observed.</p>
		  	<p>The master of the vineyard appointed laborers to work, from the early hours of the day, and then, some others joined them at the third hour, some more at the sixth hour, and towards the end of the day, at about the eleventh hour, some others joined the laborers to work in the vineyard.</p>
		  	<p>Even though some laborers worked longer hours than the others, they all earned the same amount of money at the end of the day.</p>
		  	<p>Initially, I said, “that’s not fair”, majorly considering the fact that all the jobs I’ve ever done, paid hourly, so generally, people who work for longer hours should earn more, when doing the same job in an employment. However, this case was different. I really couldn’t blame the workers who started earlier for feeling cheated.</p>
		  	<p>But on a second thought, I began to see reasons with the master of the vineyard. The laborers who started earlier in the day, might have started with much strength, passion and enthusiasm, but gotten weary over time. Therefore, their level of productivity must have gradually declined.</p>
		  	<p>We can easily liken this to our personal lives. Probably, when we first got born again, we were so passionate about the gospel, holiness and other virtues, but over time, we may have grown weary and derailed from preaching the message of the gospel.</p>
		  	<p>However, the laborers that were hired subsequently, continued in all passion and strength, knowing that the day was nearly ended and the time was short.</p>
		  	<p>Likewise beloved, the end of a thing matters much more than the beginning. It’s of no use bragging over the fact that you have been born again for 20 years, when you have probably not won any soul (low-productivity). Someone, who merely got saved at the eleventh hour, and won more souls than you ever did in your entire decades of weariness, might receive an equal reward with you at the end.</p>
		  	<p>This is the difference between physical and spiritual growth; overtaking! You can never grow faster than your elders no matter how well you feed, but spiritually, overtaking is allowed.</p>
		  	<p>A convert, who just got born-again, but grows with passion and zeal, might in no time receive more truth, light and insight to God’s Word than someone who has been a lukewarm Christian for decades.</p>
		  	<p>It is not about how long you have been in the vineyard, but how well you have worked in it. Beloved, when we first got born-again, we had this conviction to feel sorry for any little thing we did; we will never want to grieve the Holy Spirit, probably, as we continued, the passion died down, and now, we abuse grace and overlook important things.</p>
		  	<p>Beloved, there is a call for revival in this season. What happened to that passion you started up with? What happened to that fire you always fanned to flames through constant meditation and prayers?</p>
		  	<p>There is a Divine message for you today — Don’t let the passion, zeal and enthusiasm be quenched by mediocrity — Be blessed!</p>
