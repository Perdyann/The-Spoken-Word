		  	<p><i>Who wishes all men to be saved and [increasingly] to perceive and recognize and discern and know precisely and correctly the [divine] Truth. (1 Timothy 2:4)</i></p>

		  	<blockquote>God did not send you to the earth to be saved. If salvation was your sole purpose, you would have died immediately after. There is more to our purpose on earth than obtaining salvation. </blockquote>

		  	<p>God will have all men obtain salvation, and thereafter, come to the knowledge of the Truth. Verily, not all Christians perceive, recognize, discern and know the truth; some are being driven away by silly myths, doctrines, and perhaps theological facts. The truth transcends all these.</p>
		  	<p>With the heart, we believe and with the mouth, confession is made unto salvation. (Romans 10:10) Many indeed believe, and have confessed Jesus as Lord. These fellows have obtained salvation, but some stopped right there.</p>
		  	<p>Salvation is the foundation, but not all that is required. God did not send you to the earth to be saved. No! If salvation was your sole purpose, you would have died immediately after, having fulfilled it. However, there is more to our purpose on earth than obtaining salvation.</p>
		  	<p>God’s first wish is for all men to be saved. Notice, this scripture did not stop there. It continues, <i> “ ... and [increasingly] to perceive and recognize and discern and know precisely and correctly the [divine] Truth.”</i></p>
		  	<p>Salvation is the baseline, but not the end of the equation. Add to your salvation Knowledge of the Truth.</p>
		  	<p>Many churches teach theological facts, but the Truth transcends such facts. The truth of God’s Word is the revelation of Him. It is easy to browse through the bible and obtain facts, but when you intentionally decide to meditate constantly on the Word, you receive deep insights and revelations, which is the Truth of God’s Word.</p>
		  	<p>Don’t stop at salvation; make the Word your food. It is indeed food; you cannot grow and be enriched without feeding on it. Salvation is not the end of the journey, it is only the beginning.</p>
		  	<p>The truth of God’s Word is not just the teachings we hear in sermons, but the revelation the Spirit gives when we fellowship in His presence.</p>
		  	<p>Every Christian should dare to step further from the salvation line, and get to a personal and intimate relationship with the Holy Spirit. He is the one that is sent to teach us all things (the Truth inclusive)</p>
		  	<p>The Christian life cannot be effective without the Holy Spirit. God wants every man to be saved, and also have a personal relationship with the Holy Spirit.</p>
		  	<p>More than I am willing to teach the Word of God to all men, I desire to have them understand, discern and know the Truth of God’s Word for themselves, through constant meditation.</p>
		  	<p>After Salvation, go for Knowledge of the Truth of God’s Word; it makes life worth living. Be blessed!</p>
