		  	<p><i>And he said, Wherefore wilt thou go to him to day? it is neither new moon, nor sabbath. And she said, It shall be well.</i></p>
		  	<p><i>Run now, I pray thee, to meet her, and say unto her, Is it well with thee? is it well with thy husband? is it well with the child? And she answered, It is well: (2 Kings 4:23&26)</i></p>

		  	<blockquote>It takes a change in your confession to make a difference in your situation. </blockquote>

		  	<p>Until your confession change, you can never face transformation. It takes a change in your confession to make a difference in your situation.</p>
		  	<p>Here’s the case of the Shunammite woman, whose son had just died; she did not give up, seeing that her son was dead, instead, she hoped that something miraculous could still happen.</p>
		  	<p>The death of her son did not change her confession, but improved it. I believe no one with a dead son will admit that all is well; every normal person would have responded to the Prophet with complains, but she responded with a confession.</p>
		  	<p>Likewise, until you substitute your complain with a powerful confession, you cannot encounter transformation.</p>
		  	<p>The most interesting aspect of her faith is the increase in her confession. Notice, that despite her son’s death, she still confessed, It shall be well, but it got to a point when she had to make a more powerful confession saying, It is well, Beloved, she had to call the miracle forth, to the present time.</p>
		  	<p>As long as she kept confessing that it shall be well, her son remained dead, but there was still hope of recovery. It was not until she stretched her faith to the next level, by declaring that it is well already, that her Son eventually received his healing.</p>
		  	<p>I always confessed that God is with me, but when I grew in revelation, that ceased to be the case; I started confessing that He is in me. Every new revelation attracts a new confession that manifests a new result.</p>
		  	<p>If you want to have a new result, start by making a new confession. I challenge you to make a powerful confession that you have not made before.</p>
		  	<p>The woman in question is one with a dead son, who chose to retain a positive confession. Situations may not always seem pleasant, but don’t let your situation define your confession, instead, let your confession transform your situation.</p>
		  	<p>Just like the Shunammite woman, we need to grow from confessing—‘it will be well’, to confessing — ‘it is well’; we need to grow from saying — ‘I will be rich’, to saying — ‘I am rich’. We need to call forth the future anticipation to the present time.</p>
		  	<p>Stop making <i>'will'</i> confessions, make <i>'now'</i> confessions. It is not enough to hope that you will be healed someday; why not now?</p>
		  	<p>Just an increase in confession can catapult you, in a single day, to a realm that took men years of toil to get to. Be blessed!</p>
