		  	<p><i>But we all, with open face beholding as in a glass the glory of the Lord, are changed into the same image from glory to glory, even as by the Spirit of the Lord. (2 Corinthians 3:18)</i></p>
		  

		  	<blockquote>A man with great vision is bound to do exploit!</blockquote>

		  	<p>The image you constantly behold is what you will be transformed into. When you behold negative images, you’d experience instability in every way. Likewise, a man with great vision is bound to do exploit!</p>
		  	<p>As we behold the glory of God, we are not just transformed to be great, but we are actually changed into the same image as Him.</p>
		  	<p>This is powerful and interesting! I always thought that my image was like that of God; thus, I concluded that I was Christ-like, until I encountered this scripture. My image is not like Gods’; no! My image is the same with God’s own.</p>
		  	<p>As we behold the glory of God with unveiled faces, we are changed into the same image as His. What is the image you have of God?</p>
		  	<p>If you were told to close your eyes and create an image of God in your mind, what image will you envisage? I believe it will be a glorious and perfect being. Will you envisage a cancer stricken image? Will you envisage a poor man? No!</p>
		  	<p>God cannot be sick, poor, limited, or weak. If indeed we have the same image as He has, then there is no reason why we should be sick, poor, limited or weak. You are just as glorious as the image you envisage of God.</p>
		  	<p>However, when you are blinded by a veil, and cannot comprehend this great truth, it remains unreal to you; thus, you cannot function in the image of God. On the other hand, when you behold His glory with an unveiled face, you cannot but be transformed into His exact image.</p>
		  	<p>The reason why many have fallen short of God’s glory is because they did not behold his glory with an unveiled face.</p>
		  	<p>Don’t let anyone paint an image of you, which is below the status of God. In the eyes of men, David was painted as a young boy; such that Goliath felt insulted that of all able bodied men to be posed against, they presented David.</p>
		  	<p>What they failed to realize is that David bore a greater spiritual identity than being just a mere boy. He didn’t view himself from the perspective of men, but that of God. He knew that he bore the same image as God.</p>
		  	<p>In essence, he did not see that battle as one between Goliath and himself; but one between a mere uncircumcised philistine and the army of the living God (1 Samuel 17:26)</p>
		  	<p>Don’t view yourself as an ordinary man; you ceased to be ordinary the day you beheld the glory of God with an unveiled face; you ceased to be ordinary the day you encountered the Word of God; you ceased to be ordinary the day you discovered the truth. You have a greater image in God.</p>
		  	<p>You are created in the image of God, and nothing less; therefore, you are made for exploits and nothing less. Be blessed!</p>
