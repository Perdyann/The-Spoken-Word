		  	<p><i>How then shall they call on him in whom they have not believed? and how shall they believe in him of whom they have not heard? and how shall they hear without a preacher?</i></p>
		  	<p><i>And how shall they preach, except they be sent? as it is written, How beautiful are the feet of them that preach the gospel of peace, and bring glad tidings of good things! (Romans 10:14-15)</i></p>

		  	<blockquote>People cannot be saved without believing, and they cannot believe beyond what they’ve heard.</blockquote>

		  	<p>As the scripture rightly states, salvation is obtained through confession, after one has believed unto righteousness. However, reading further, we’d realize that people cannot believe in someone, whom they have heard nothing about.</p>
		  	<p>We have studied previously that faith comes by hearing the Word; verily, no one can believe in the Word, which they have not heard enough of. In order for salvation to be received, the Word of God must be heard; and in order for the Word to be heard, it must have been spoken.</p>
		  	<p>We have been commissioned to win souls; we don’t need any other sign to prove that to us.</p>
		  	<p>Beloved, we have no greater ministry than the ministry of reconciliation through the Word of peace. Your greatest call in life is not your career even though that is good.</p>
		  	<p>Until you preach the gospel, people can never really hear about it, and until they hear about it, they can never believe, and until they believe, they can never really receive salvation.</p>
		  	<p>I was saddened at the rate of juvenile delinquency in the society; the inclination of moral decadence; and the loss of reverence for God. The youth are left with no choice than to conform to the worldly trend.</p>
		  	<p>So often, I prayed for salvation in all nations of the world, but I realized that it was not all that was required of me. There is a commission to preach the gospel; that is the key to salvation.</p>
		  	<p>I cannot expect people to receive salvation when they’ve not even heard enough of God’s Word. There’s no point praying for salvation when the Word has not yet been preached.</p>
		  	<p>People cannot be saved without believing, and they cannot believe beyond what they’ve heard. Seeing then that they cannot hear without a preacher, how can souls be saved? Preach!</p>
		  	<p>Even when you’ve got nothing to preach about, make a message out of your testimony. When Jesus casted out evil spirits (legion) from a certain man, He sent him to go and share his testimony, telling everyone what God had done for Him (Luke 8:39). That fellow was not a Pastor, but preached a message; your testimony is not too little a message to be preached.</p>
		  	<p>The only thing someone needs to hear now might be your testimony. Start from there. You don’t need to occupy a spiritual office to share the good news; start from your home, office or academic institution.</p>
		  	<p>Growing up, I thought that preaching was a call for Pastors, Apostles and Prophets. In no time, I realized that it is a commission for all Sons of God.</p>
		  	<p>Regard preaching the gospel of peace as your primary assignment; every other thing is secondary. If you are really passionate about souls, then you’d go any length to preach the gospel of peace; it is worth hearing. Share the Word with someone today. Be blessed!</p>
