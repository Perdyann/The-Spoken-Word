		  	<p><i>Ye are my friends, if ye do whatsoever I command you.</i></p>
		  	<p><i>Henceforth I call you not servants; for the servant knoweth not what his lord doeth: but I have called you friends; for all things that I have heard of my Father I have made known unto you. (John 15:14-15)</i></p>
		 


		  	<blockquote>A personal view of how you relate with God gives you a clearer understanding of your stand. </blockquote>

		  	<p>To everyone, He is the creator of the entire universe; He is the fountain of Living waters; He is the beginning and the end; it is He, who stirs up the sea and it’s waves roar; it is He, who appointed the sun to shine by day, and the moon to govern the night; it is He, who declares unto man the thoughts of his heart; The Lord Almighty is His name.</p>
		  	<p>Words, time and space are not enough to describe the splendor of the Lord.</p>
		  	<p>It is amazing to fathom that Jesus, being the only Son of God, and Word of God, which became flesh, still chose to refer to His disciples, as friends, and not servants.</p>
		  	<p>The relationship of a master to a servant is nothing compared to the relationship between friends. Masters don’t reason together with their servants, but friends do reason together with each other.</p>
		  	<p>Beloved, we are more than just servants to God; we are friends of God.</p>
		  	<p>Have you ever drifted your focus from who everyone sees Him as, to who you see Him as? Who is the Lord to you? I can praise the Lord, and constantly tell Him what He means to the whole world, and I can go further by describing who He is to me.</p>
		  	<p>To the whole world, He is the master of the universe, but He doesn’t stop there for me. He is my confidant!</p>
		  	<p>It is always good, not just to look at God from the perspective of everyone else, but also to have a personal view. A personal view of how you relate with God gives you a clearer understanding of your stand.</p>
		  	<p>He is my best friend; the first person I talk to when I wake up, and the last person I speak with before I retire at night; In His arms do I take refuge always; when I really need to talk to someone, He is the one I always go to; He gives me direction in everything.</p>
		  	<p>When I think of His goodness, my soul is highly delighted; think back of the days when evil would have befallen you, but He stepped in; think about when everyone judged you, but He spoke on your behalf; think about the battles He fought for you.</p>
		  	<p>Sometimes, we don’t understand in details the magnitude of things God has done for us; the evil He has averted for our sake.</p>
		  	<p>To me, He means much more than what the world regards Him as; He is the hope I have for a bright future. He is my only plan. He is the reason I am confidently living today. Outside God, I have no future, hope or plan whatsoever.</p>
		  	<p>Beloved, think about who the Lord is to you. We all know that God is the creator of the entire universe, but it just can’t stop there. God wants to relate closely with each of his Children</p>
		  	<p>Don’t stop at being a regular Sunday service attendee; it’s not only in the Church God can speak to you; you can hear Him in your bedroom. God wants you to have a deeper personal knowledge of Him. It is written:</p>
		  	<p><i>And the scripture was fulfilled which saith, Abraham believed God, and it was imputed unto him for righteousness: and he was called the Friend of God. (James 2:23)</i></p>
		  	<p>Even Abraham, was called the friend of God; God’s desire is for everyone to grow in personal knowledge of Him; to hear Him always, and be directed by His Word.</p>
		  	<p>You cannot grow to live a fulfilled life, without having a personal time and relationship with God. Study constantly, abide in His presence, and be directed by the Holy Spirit. You were made to be greater than what you are today. Be blessed!</p>
