		  	<p><i>This book of the law shall not depart out of thy mouth; but thou shalt meditate therein day and night, that thou mayest observe to do according to all that is written therein: for then thou shalt make thy way prosperous, and then thou shalt have good success. (Joshua 1:8)</i></p>
		  	

		  	<blockquote>There is a mystery about utterances; it releases power. The utterance of God’s Word births power.</blockquote>

		  	<p>There’s something I love about this scripture—it is never said that the book of law shall not depart from our sight, but our mouth.</p>
		  	<p>Quite a lot of people use this scripture to admonish others to read the bible. In reality, this scripture actually transcends merely reading the bible . . . it entails confessing the spoken Word of God.</p>
		  	<p>If the command was for us to read the bible day and night, then it would be said that the book should not depart out of our sight; but the message is that we should confess the Words therein.</p>
		  	<p>Even if it is just one Rhema that you have received in a season, do not stop speaking it. Keep uttering those Words. There is a mystery about utterances; it releases power.</p>
		  	<p>It is not enough that you read the Word of God and probably learnt something new; if what you learnt is not uttered in faith, then it will most likely not have any effect on you.</p>
		  	<p>The utterance of God’s Word births power. When the devil tempted Jesus, he overcame by declaring the Words of God. Don’t just gaze at the scriptures with your optical eyes, meditate intently, and be sure to declare Rhema.</p>
		  	<p>There is an assurance affixed to this scripture — <i>for then thou shalt make thy way prosperous, and then thou shalt have good success.</i> The key to walking in prosperity and success is constantly declaring the Word of God, in and out of seasons.</p>
		  	<p>Many of those lying on the hospital beds, infirmed with one disease or another, have probably read the scripture that states, <i> and with his stripes we are healed. (Isaiah 53:5),</i> but I’m certain that most of them have not spoken in faith that “I AM HEALED.” The power is released when the declaration is made in faith.</p>
		  	<p>Are you going through a situation, which seems to have no way out? Meditate on the Word of God, receive insights and Rhema. Declare it day and night; by so doing, you are speaking your way out of that situation, obtaining good success, and paving a prosperous path for yourself.</p>
		  	<p>Never stop speaking the Word of God; there is power in declaring His promises over your life.</p>
		  	<p>When I meditate on God’s Word, it stirs me up to make powerful declarations. Never study the Word, without speaking. It is not enough that you have the Word within your reach; it is not enough that you have it in sight; let it not depart from your mouth. Speak it! Be blessed!</p>
