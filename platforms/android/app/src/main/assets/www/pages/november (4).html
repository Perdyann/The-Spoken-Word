		  	<p><i>Wash me throughly from mine iniquity, and cleanse me from my sin.</i></p>
		  	<p><i>For I acknowledge my transgressions: and my sin is ever before me. (Psalm 51:2-3)</i></p>
		  	

		  	<blockquote>There is nothing wrong with making a mistake, but everything becomes wrong when we deny our mistakes.</blockquote>

		  	<p>The only reason why some people will not apologize is because they don’t believe that they are wrong. Most people are of the opinion that those at fault should be the ones to apologize; thus, when two parties cannot admit that they are wrong, apology is withheld, and the conflict is prolonged.</p>
		  	<p>David acknowledged the fact that he was wrong; the issue we have most times is our failure to acknowledge our wrongs. Sometimes, we are so bent on justifying our actions, even when we know so well that we have acted wrongly.</p>
		  	<p>There are times when I was engaged in an argument for so long; deep within me, I knew that I did not get it all so right, but I outrightly tried to justify myself by my speech. I tried to give reasons for doing things, which I knew were wrong.</p>
		  	<p>David could have decided to give God reasons why he did what he did. He could have said, “Lord, I was tired, that’s why I retired OR Lord, I was tempted that’s why I laid with Bathsheba OR Lord, I needed to get Uriah out of the way, that’s why I killed him” No! He acknowledged that he had no reason for doing wrong, and then apologized.</p>
		  	<p>Sometimes, we should refrain from justifying ourselves, and just admit our wrongs. There is nothing wrong with making a mistake, but everything becomes wrong when we deny our mistakes.</p>
		  	<p>Some people will go to any length to cover up for their wrongs; they’d tell lies, kill, bribe or even steal, all in a bid to cover up. David would have saved himself loss if he had acknowledged his wrongs earlier on.</p>
		  	<p>Quite alright, he did wrong by sleeping with Bathsheba; but actually, he even did more wrongs in trying to cover up—He became a deceitful liar and murderer in order to hide his adulterous acts.</p>
		  	<p>You can never cover up sinful deeds with iniquity; be humble enough to acknowledge your wrongs and apologize for them. Be blessed!</p>
