		  	<p><i>Whoever brings blessing will be enriched, and one who waters will himself be watered. (Proverbs 11:25 ERV)</i></p>
		 

		  	<blockquote>True enrichment is not derived from the blessing itself, but in being a blessing to others.</blockquote>

		  	<p>Our emphasis today will be on the first aspect of this scripture. Many people are in dire need of blessings, they keep praying, “bless me o Lord”, however, some others are seeking means, through which they can be a blessing to everyone.</p>
		  	<p>What the former fails to realize is that in blessing others, we are enriched and blessed. There is a unique enrichment reserved for those who bring forth blessings.</p>
		  	<p>Notice, in this scripture, enrichment is not promised to everyone, but specifically to the bringers of blessings. It is now obvious that in blessing others, we are indirectly storing up blessings for ourselves.</p>
		  	<p>When I did not know better, I was always pursuing blessings: I used to pray, “Lord, please bless me more ...” In no time, when I realized this truth, I began to pray, “Lord, make me a channel of blessing. I want to be a blessing to the world.”</p>
		  	<p>Beloved, from the moment I grew in this revelation, the reverse became the case — I stopped pursuing blessings, and they started following me supernaturally.</p>
		  	<p>True enrichment is not derived from the blessing itself, but in being a blessing to others. If you want to be enriched, start by blessing someone.</p>
		  	<p>No matter the degree of penury a man faces, he can still be a blessing if he decides to. Apart from our finances, we have talents to give, a heart of love, and deeds we can commit to without pay.</p>
		  	<p>If I will not bless you financially, I could bless you with my talents; if not in talents or gifts, I can bless you by an act of love, my prayer and support. No man has nothing to give, except he says so.</p>
		  	<p>There is always a way, in which we can be a blessing to our world. An act of love might be neglected by men, but verily, it does not go unnoticed by God. Men may not always thank you for what you have done, but God will always enrich you for every blessing you have brought. Be a blessing to someone today.</p>
		  	<p>When I needed financial blessings for some project at hand, I had not enough, but gave out of the little I had. In no time, I was enriched with much more than I needed for my project.</p>
		  	<p>The key to divine blessing is not seeking it, but giving it. Bless and you shall be enriched, water and you shall be watered. Be blessed!</p>
