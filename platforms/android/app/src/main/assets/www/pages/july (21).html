		  	<p><i>And Samson called unto the Lord, and said, O Lord God, remember me, I pray thee, and strengthen me, I pray thee, only this once, O God, that I may be at once avenged of the Philistines for my two eyes. (Judges 16:28)</i></p>
		  
		  	<blockquote>Samson lost his hair; he lost his strength; but never lost hope. Verily, as long as hope lives, everything else is alive. </blockquote>

		  	<p>One of the most painful feelings is losing something that you once had; the longing to possess something that was freely in your possession previously, hurts so bad.</p>
		  	<p>Many are not only hurt by the fact that they don’t have, but the fact that they no longer have what they used to have. However, with a single realization, you can reign above every hurt and aches of the past.</p>
		  	<p>You’re still in time for reestablishment. It’s never too late to recover all that you’ve lost. Never!</p>
		  	<p>Samson had made a very regrettable mistake; he had spilled out a secret that was not meant to be exposed; he had given his enemies an edge over him. He lost his hair; he lost his strength; but never lost hope. Verily, as long as hope lives, everything else is alive.</p>
		  	<p>Just when his enemies thought that they had finally got a hold on him; just when they had made him a laughing stock; just when everyone declared that the mighty had fallen; Behold, the hair began to grow back; he said a prayer of faith, and all that was lost became his again.</p>
		  	<p>Once more, he had his hair; once more, he had strength. The bible recorded, that the number of people he killed at his death were much more than those he killed during his lifetime. In essence, the strength he had all his lifetime was nothing compared to what he gained at his death.</p>
		  	<p>He made more achievements during his death, than all he ever gained in his lifetime. He was remembered more for his death than his life. Indeed, it is never too late to be reestablished; God can perform a miracle, even at the last hour.</p>
		  	<p>That’s the exact reason why I keep saying, “God does much more than mere restoration! He reestablishes ...” He does not merely give you back what you had, but even more.</p>
		  	<p>Samson did not regain his previous strength; he got more than that. Beloved, you are still in time for a reestablishment.</p>
		  	<p>They took away the most valuable thing Samson had, by giving him a shave, but God reestablished him.</p>
		  	<p>This also proves that the source of Samson’s strength was not just his hair, but the root. They could shave his hair, but could not tamper with its root. As long as the root is there, the hair can always grow back.</p>
		  	<p>Beloved, men may have taken away the most valuable part of you; they may have tampered with the most vital aspect of your life; but remember, the God who reestablished Samson when all was lost is capable of doing greater to you.</p>
		  	<p>We may have made mistakes; we may have spilled out too much information; but with a single prayer of faith, we can recover much more than we had previously.</p>
		  	<p>Rather than counting your loss; say a prayer of faith, and be assured of all you’ve ever hoped for. No amount of loss can ruin your chances of being reestablished. Be blessed!</p>
