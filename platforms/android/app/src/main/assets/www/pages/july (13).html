		  <div class="panel-body" style="text-align:justify">


		  	<p><i>But Jacob said, “Swear to me first.” So he swore an oath to him, selling his birthright to Jacob.</i></p>
		  	<p><i>Then Jacob gave Esau some bread and some lentil stew. He ate and drank, and then got up and left.</i></p>
		  	<p><i>So Esau despised his birthright. (Genesis 25:33-34)</i></p>


		  	<blockquote>No virtue remains in the  hand of a man, who has devalued it. A great life is a life that discerns genuine values. </blockquote>

		  	<p>The mistakes of many men emanated from their act of attributing wrong values to certain things. If you don’t understand the value of what you have, you are prone to losing it in no time. No virtue remains in the hand of a man, who has devalued it.</p>
		  	<p>Studying carefully through this scripture, I wondered, “is a pot of lentil stew and bread really worth Esau’s birthright?” Enduring the hunger for a moment and retaining his birthright would not have killed him; but because he undervalued what he had, he lost it.</p>
		  	<p>His birthright placed him in a position of greatness; it defined him as an heir to his Father; it qualified him to be the recipient of the blessings of his Father; it paved way to such a great destiny for him.</p>
		  	<p>However, Esau never realized all these. In his perspective, his birthright was nothing compared to the temporal satisfaction that a pot of lentil stew could give. His mistake, which manifested fully at a later time, emanated from his act of devaluing what he had.</p>
		  	<p>When it was time for the first son to be blessed, Esau still expected to be blessed, but Jacob received the blessing in place of him. This was no earthly arrangement, verily, it was divinely orchestrated. Esau had already sold his birthright; he didn’t deserve to be blessed anyways. Losing his blessing commenced the very day he sold his birthright!</p>
		  	<p>We need to learn the true value of things! A great life is a life that discerns genuine values. If you really understand value, you will know that money is not as valuable as its source; wisdom is not as valuable as its giver; a pot of stew is not as valuable as birthright.</p>
		  	<p>Esau’s birthright could grant him many pots of stew, but a single pot of stew could never earn him a birthright.</p>
		  	<p>Many people have made similar mistakes; they’ve traded valuable treasures for less valuable things; they’ve traded diamonds for mere stones; they’ve traded a lifetime for a single day; they’ve traded destiny for temporal satisfaction; they’ve traded eternity for vanity.</p>
		  	<p>If you could understand the real value of what you have, you will never seek any exchange.</p>
		  	<p>Why trade your body for money? Is it really worth it? Your body is much more valuable than what money can buy.</p>
		  	<p>Why trade your soul for the pleasures of the world? Is it really worth it? The world is temporal, but eternity minus a millennium equals eternity; the final destination of your soul matters more than the phases it goes through.</p>
		  	<p>Attribute the right values to everything! Regard vanity as vanity, and heavenly treasures in high esteem. Be blessed!</p>
