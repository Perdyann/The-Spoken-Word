		  	<p><i>No temptation has overtaken you that is not common to man. God is faithful, and he will not let you be tempted beyond your ability, but with the temptation he will also provide the way of escape, that you may be able to endure it. (1 Corinthians 10:13 ESV)</i></p>

		  	<blockquote>The only limit of men is the limit they have placed on their ability. When you understand that you can do all things, there is nothing that remains undone. </blockquote>

		  	<p>There is no trial or temptation you face, that is beyond human experience. Verily, you are not the only one that’s indebted, financially drained, emotionally crushed, or depressed. By the way, what you are going through is nothing compared to what some people have been through.</p>
		  	<p>Someone once said, “I was complaining that I had no shoes, until I saw someone without legs.” Indeed, every temptation, trial and challenge that exists, has been experienced by someone. You are not the first person to approach that mountain; neither will you be the last.</p>
		  	<p>You are not the first to have been lured and enticed by your sinful desires. It is a common thing; however, the ability to say no is in you. God has vested on us the ability to overcome every temptation.</p>
		  	<p>Temptation is a respecter of no man; Jesus Christ was tempted. The sin is not in being tempted, but in yielding to temptation.</p>
		  	<p>By this scripture, we are assured that God will never let us be tempted beyond our ability. God allowed the devil to tempt Job in every way, because He knew that the temptation was not beyond Job’s ability.</p>
		  	<p>What you are going through is not something you cannot handle. God assures us that He will never let us be tempted beyond our resistance.</p>
		  	<p>What do you think was going through the mind of Shedrach, Meshach and Abednego when the fire was being heated? They could easily have just changed their minds and bowed, but verily, God had bestowed on them the ability to stand firm against all odds.</p>
		  	<p>Likewise, God has given us the ability to overcome; you can choose not to compromise your faith, no matter how tough the trial gets; you can choose not to give up, no matter how rough the road gets. No trial you ever face is beyond your ability.</p>
		  	<p>David was faced with mighty Goliath, but he defeated him by a single understanding—Goliath is not beyond my ability—Verily, the Spirit of God in you, has enabled you to do all things. If only you can look at that giant in your life courageously, and declare, “You are not beyond my ability,” you will surely overcome.</p>
		  	<p>The only limit of men is the limit they have placed on their ability. When you understand that you can do all things, there is nothing that remains undone.</p>
		  	<p>Beloved, we are further assured by this scripture that God will always provide a way of escape.</p>
		  	<p>Moses and the Israelites were caught between the Egyptians and the red sea, but God provided a way out. Hagar and her son were thirsty, almost unto death, but God opened her eyes to a well of water. Daniel was casted to the den of lions, but God brought him out unharmed.</p>
		  	<p>It is obvious that no matter how hot the fire is; God will always lead you out of it unharmed.</p>
		  	<p>That project at hand is not beyond your ability to implement; your destiny is not beyond your ability to reach; that red sea is not beyond your ability to cross; the mountain is not beyond your ability to climb.</p>
		  	<p>Henceforth, operate with this mindset—there is nothing you ever experience, that is beyond your ability to handle—Be blessed!</p>
