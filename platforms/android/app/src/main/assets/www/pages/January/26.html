		  	<blockquote>To unlock the best of potentials in you, regard your service as though it were unto God and not men. If you can’t be entrusted with service, you’d never be given servants</blockquote>

		  	<p>There are seasons when I rendered services to some associations, and in that time, due to my dissatisfaction with their reciprocity, I should have left, but for this one word. If we were to do things for men, we will probably not put in our best... we will probably lack the required level of commitment.</p>
		  	<p>We are admonished to work heartily as to the Lord and not unto men. Sometimes, the people we work for don’t seem to deserve our service, but you must learn to develop that mindset that you are not working for them after all... Your service is unto God and not men, so put in your best.</p>
		  	<p>To what level are you committed to your service in Church, meetings, work, amongst others? Understand that you are not working unto your pastor, president, or boss. To unlock the best of potentials in you, regard your service as though it were unto God and not men. Lord Chesterfield quoted, “Whatsoever is worth doing at all is worth doing well.” Indeed, there’s no point doing something that your mind is not set to achieve. If it is worth doing, then do it well.</p>
		  	<p>I recall the parable of the talents in Matthew 25:14 and Luke 19:11. It was a season when the master of the house distributed talents to his servants based on their abilities, with the expectation that they would invest it wisely and make profitable returns.</p>
		  	<p>The servant with the least talents collected it, probably, with an attitude of moaning. He was very displeased with his master, and so he tried to get back at him by burying the talents. Indeed, this servant had not enough insight from the Word of God to realize that he should regard his service as unto God and not man. It pays to serve right.</p>
		  	<p>If you can’t be entrusted with service, you’d never be given servants. Before you can be served, God has to be sure that you are a good and faithful servant.</p>
		  	<p>Whatever you do (In eating, drinking, speaking, acting, studying) Work heartily (With all your mind, focus, and attention) as unto the Lord, and not unto man. What are you doing presently? Whatever you are now, a student, doctor, banker, amongst others—is your service presentable to God? Will he approve of it?</p>
		  	<p>O what transformations the world could face if every man had this mentality; if the politicians and leaders were working diligently unto God and not man... if the civilians were working faithfully unto God and not man... if the masses were working heartily unto God and not man... if the students were working attentively unto God and not man. The change is possible, and it begins with you. Have this mentality always, and do it right. Be blessed!</p>
