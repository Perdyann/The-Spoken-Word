		  	<h5><strong>LOVE: Greatest Love of All</strong></h5>


		  	<p><i>Greater love hath no man than this, that a man lay down his life for his friends. (John 15:13)</i></p>
		  


		  	<blockquote>Sacrifice is the nature of love. If you’ve never found anything worth sacrificing for, then you’ve never loved.</blockquote>

		  	<p>The greatest love of all is the love that is sacrificial. This was fully portrayed when Jesus laid down his life, forsook his identity, and bore our iniquity that we may reign in life. He was bruised and chastised that we may become the righteousness of God. He didn’t withhold His life, but gave it up, that we may live.</p>
		  	<p>Sacrifice is the nature of love. When there is no sacrifice, there is no love. Lack of sacrifice is a concrete evidence of the absence of love. Love is the greatest giver! If you’ve never found anything worth sacrificing for, then you’ve never loved.</p>
		  	<p>I once heard a story of a couple who were deeply in love with each other, but didn’t have enough resources to portray their love. Even so, the lack of resources never served as a hindrance to their love. They approached a very important season in their lives, and it was such a season when the woman was expected to look her best.</p>
		  	<p>Her hair was very much un-kept, and they couldn’t afford to get it dressed. The husband, in an attempt to please his wife, rushed out of the house, empty handed, and returned sooner with no shoes, but a little money, which will just be enough to improve his wife’s looks.</p>
		  	<p>To his greatest surprise, he met his wife looking all bald... she shaved her hair. Indeed, while he was busy trying to sacrifice his shoes (compromise his looks) to make his wife look good, she was also in the game of sacrificing her hair (compromising her looks), to make her husband financially comfortable. I have never seen any type of love that does not give... no! It’s not love.</p>
		  	<p>John 3:16 quotes, <i> “For God so loved the world, <b>that he gave </b> his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.” </i>Giving is the greatest attribute of love! In expression of God’s love for the world, he gave. If we should follow the footsteps of the Master, we should start by giving.</p>
		  	<p>The best way to keep the commandment of love is to live the life of the Father... The best way to live the life of the Father is to love like the Father loves... The best way to love like the Father loves is to give like the Father gives. What greater love is there than laying down something that matters so much to you? What greater love is there than sacrifice?</p>
		  	<p><i>Jesus said unto him, Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy mind. This is the first and great commandment.</i></p>
		  	<p><i>And the second is like unto it, Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself. (Matthew 22:36-39)</i></p>
		  	<p>Love is not just a new commandment, but the greatest commandment. If indeed love is the greatest commandment, and sacrifice is the nature of love, then we can conclude that there is no greater quality than sacrifice!</p>
		  	<p>There are so many changes we need to make in our lives. We pray sometimes, saying to the Father, “I love you LORD”, well, if we really love the Lord, then we should be ready to sacrifice a couple of hours in a day to be alone with God... we should be able to treat our neighbors with love... we should be able to give!</p>
		  	<p>Brethren, ponder on this today... We must learn to act love, and not just claim it. Be blessed!</p>
