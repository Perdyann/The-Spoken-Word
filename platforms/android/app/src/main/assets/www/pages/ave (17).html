		  	<p><i>Then this Daniel was distinguished above the presidents and the satraps because an excellent spirit was in him, and the king thought to set him over the whole realm. (Daniel 6:3)</i></p>


		  	<blockquote>With an Excellent Spirit, we can soar on heights that mere-spirited men could never attain. Excellence elevates a man from the place of mediocrity, to a realm of recognition. </blockquote>

		  	<p>There’s just one reason why Daniel was exalted, distinguished, and placed in charge of the entire realm; he had an excellent Spirit in him.</p>
		  	<p>Man is a spirit, the results a man can produce is based on the ability of the spirit that is resident in him. The body of a man is never void of a spirit!</p>
		  	<p>There are confessions that I can never change: I have got an excellent Spirit! The Holy Ghost functions in my body! Verily, with this consciousness always, we can stroll through the tallest mountain as though it were plain ground.</p>
		  	<p>With an Excellent Spirit, we can soar on heights that mere-spirited men could never attain. Excellence elevates a man from the place of mediocrity, to a realm of recognition.</p>
		  	<p>The bible in various instances; makes us to understand that the Holy Spirit is resident in us. It is written,</p>
		  	<p><i>But if the Spirit of him that raised up Jesus from the dead dwell in you, he that raised up Christ from the dead shall also quicken your mortal bodies by his Spirit that dwelleth in you. (Romans 8:11)</i></p>
		  	<p>Brethren, the Spirit of God not only dwells in us, but functions in us. We are the occupation of the Holy Ghost. If indeed, the Holy Spirit lives and functions in us, then it is right to conclude that His ability has become our ability.</p>
		  	<p>We are no longer defined by what we, in our human capacity can do, but what God can do. It is no longer I who functions and acts, but the Holy Spirit that acts through me; it is no longer I who speak, but God speaks through me. Therefore, there is no limit to the results we can produce.</p>
		  	<p>Whatsoever you touch is blessed, because God touched it; no one encounters you and remains the same, because an encounter with you is an encounter with God.</p>
		  	<p>When a man functions from his natural ability, he produces common and ordinary results; however we, functioning from our deposit of grace, can only produce uncommon results, because we have got an excellent spirit.</p>
		  	<p>We are born to excel! Every day of our lives ushers in promotion in all spheres; there is nothing we cannot accomplish . . . we have got an excellent spirit. It is written</p>
		  	<p><i>I can do all things through Christ which strengtheneth me. (Philippians 4:13)</i></p>
		  	<p>Verily, there is nothing we cannot do; we have an Excellent Spirit. We act not of our own strength, ability, and accord; but the Power of the Holy Ghost inside us, finds expression outwardly.</p>
		  	<p>In summary, we must understand that the reason why Daniel’s work was better than all is not because of the strength of his muscles or any physical factor, but he was made distinct, by the excellence of the Holy Spirit in him.</p>
		  	<p>Likewise, we are going higher every second, not because of our physical assets, but because the Holy Spirit dwells in us. God’s ability is my ability. Be blessed!</p>
