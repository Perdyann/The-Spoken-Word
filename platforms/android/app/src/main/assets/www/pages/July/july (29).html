		  	<p><i>So the people shouted when the priests blew with the trumpets: and it came to pass, when the people heard the sound of the trumpet, and the people shouted with a great shout, that the wall fell down flat, so that the people went up into the city, every man straight before him, and they took the city. (Joshua 6:20)</i></p>
		  

		  	<blockquote>Praise can accomplish within days, what ordinarily will take years to achieve.</blockquote>

		  	<p>After Moses had died, Joshua was appointed to lead Israel. He was to lead the children of Israel into their promise land. Breaking through the gigantic walls of Jericho was the first challenge to be tackled.</p>
		  	<p>God had told them to walk round the city once for six days, and walk round seven times on the seventh day, praising with trumpets and horns, and making a joyful noise, bearing with them the Ark of the Lord.</p>
		  	<p>Interestingly, God never commanded them to ram through the walls of Jericho; they had no need to plan a demolishing scheme; they had no need to struggle to get through. All they had to do was praise.</p>
		  	<p>As they summed up their acts of praising in faith on the seventh day, the gigantic walls of Jericho fell down flat like a plain; and they finally possessed their promise land.</p>
		  	<p>Who will ever believe that the promise land, which took them through stages of tests in the wilderness, for many years, will be so easy to possess? That’s how easy we can gain access to our long awaited inheritance when we choose to praise.</p>
		  	<p>It is amazing to comprehend that our praise can do much more than our muscles can.</p>
		  	<p>I’m quite certain that if they were to use their arm, muscles and strength, to break down flat, the mighty and gigantic walls of Jericho, it would have taken them over a month. But with praise, the walls were flat in seven days.</p>
		  	<p>Praise can accomplish within days, what ordinarily will take years to achieve. If only everyone understands the power of praise, life will be much easier.</p>
		  	<p>Complains will never grant you your desire; compromise can only give you a counterfeit life; your human ability can only produce average and common results; but praise grants you folds of uncommon and extra-ordinary results.</p>
		  	<p>Why complain when you can praise; why compromise to gain access when you can praise your way through.</p>
		  	<p>Beloved if Jericho, in all its might, size and strength, could be laid flat by praise; there is no gate, not of brass, bronze or silver, that cannot be rammed by praise.</p>
		  	<p>The challenges we face in life can be compared to gates of limitation that we struggle to pass through. It is interesting to know that by praise, you can gain easy access through these gates. Even the greatest challenges and battles in life submit to praise.</p>
		  	<p>Choose to live a life of praise; always remember that you can praise your way through all of life’s challenges. Be blessed!</p>
