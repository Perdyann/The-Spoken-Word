		  	<p><i>Therefore let anyone who thinks he stands [who feels sure that he has a steadfast mind and is standing firm], take heed lest he fall [into sin]. (1 Corinthians 10:12 AMP)</i></p>
		 
		  	<blockquote>When a man becomes  too confident of his stand, that he no longer hearkens nor obeys, a great fall  awaits him. </blockquote>

		  	<p>When a man just gives his life to Christ, he is always mindful of every step; he is careful not to derail or slide back to the place, from whence he was redeemed. </p>
		  	<p>I noticed that this no longer remains the case as time goes on. Over time, as he is strengthened in the Lord, if care is not taken, he might tend to feel so certain and sure of his steps.</p>
		  	<p>This scripture does not address everyone, but particularly, those who are so certain that they are standing firm.</p>
		  	<p>People, who are sure of their stand are not the weak, neither are they babes, but those, who are already well established. This scripture gives light to the truth that it is still possible for someone, who is well established to fall.</p>
		  	<p>Never feel too established to take heed; never feel too familiar with your route to be watchful; never feel too certain of your stand to be careful. I have seen the fall of many great men; yes, great men also fall.</p>
		  	<p>David felt too established and strong, that even when other kings went to battle in the spring, he stayed back to relax. It was in the process of that relaxation that his great fall commenced.</p>
		  	<p>God had established Solomon; he was a great and reputable King, who flourished in wealth and wisdom. God warned him not to take strange wives from certain countries, with different gods and altars.</p>
		  	<p>The only reason why Solomon neglected the warning of God was because he felt too established to take heed; he felt too certain and sure of his stand, that he was no longer careful in hearkening to the voice of the Lord, and obeying Him. In no time, the great fall of Solomon was recorded.</p>
		  	<p>Such negligence only emanates from overconfidence in ones stand, establishment and status.</p>
		  	<p>Saul was anointed by Samuel; God established him and gave him victory over every nation in battle. Sooner, because he was too sure of his stand, confident in his reputation and established in his kingdom, he failed to take heed. Great was his fall!</p>
		  	<p>To him was it said, “Obedience is better than sacrifice and to hearken than the fats of rams.” When a man becomes too confident of his stand, that he no longer hearkens nor obeys, a great fall awaits him.</p>
		  	<p>Beloved, no matter how firm you think you stand; no matter how steadfast you think your mind is, no matter how established you think you are, take heed, for great men also fall. Be blessed!</p>
