		  	<p><i>I will lift up mine eyes unto the hills, from whence cometh my help.</i></p>
		  	<p><i>My help cometh from the Lord, which made heaven and earth. (Psalms 121:1-2)</i></p>

		  	<blockquote>In the world, are all problems confined; but in God, is the master solution defined. </blockquote>

		  	<p>Your reaction to situations around you, is totally dependent on who you look up to. When you look up to God, the height of trials and tribulation is considered petty.</p>
		  	<p>When you look unto God as your strength, challenges become too small in your eyes. All you need, in order to be in charge of every situation is to have your eyes fixed on God.</p>
		  	<p>The Psalmist boldly declared that his eyes will be lifted up to the hills; he confidently pronounced his source of help, as the LORD, whom he looks up to.</p>
		  	<p>Rather than spending time on irrelevant babbles; rather than spending time considering ill situations; rather than spending time looking at worthless things; look up to the Lord, who made the heavens and the earth.</p>
		  	<p>All Peter needed, in order to walk comfortably on the stormy sea, was to have his eyes focused on Jesus. All the Israelites ever needed to get rapidly through the wilderness to the promise land, was to look up to God. All Joseph ever needed to be transformed from the pit to the palace was to look unto God.</p>
		  	<p>As long as Esther looked unto God, the Kings law seemed too small; disobeying that law could have cost her life, but as long as her eyes was fixed on purpose, she didn’t mind.</p>
		  	<p>As long as Daniel looked unto God, being thrown into the den of lions didn’t seem like a big threat.</p>
		  	<p>As long as Shedrach, Meshach and Abednego were focused on God, the heat of the fire was nothing but air-condition to them.</p>
		  	<p>When your eyes are fixed on God, you achieve the impossible. When you look unto God, your results are no longer of your ability, but the best of God’s ability.</p>
		  	<p>Why look unto the problems of this day, when God is your strength and refuge? Until you learn to look unto God alone, your problems will remain magnified in your eyes.</p>
		  	<p>When the disciples were in a boat with Jesus, and the storms began to roar against them; rather than paying too much attention to it, they looked unto Jesus for help. By His Words were the storms calmed.</p>
		  	<p>Though the storms of life rage ferociously against you; look unto the Author and Finisher of your fate.</p>
		  	<p>In the world, are all problems confined; but in God, is the master solution defined.</p>
		  	<p>In a world of uncertainty, turbulence and troubles, choose to look unto God, from whence help cometh. Verily, there is no situation beyond God’s solution. Be blessed!</p>
