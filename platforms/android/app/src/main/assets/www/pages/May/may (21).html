		  	<p><i>And we know that all things work together for good to them that love God, to them who are the called according to his purpose.</i></p>
		  	<p><i>For whom he did foreknow, he also did predestinate to be conformed to the image of his Son, that he might be the firstborn among many brethren.</i></p>
		  	<p><i>Moreover whom he did predestinate, them he also called: and whom he called, them he also justified: and whom he justified, them he also glorified. (Romans 8:28-30)</i></p>


		  	<blockquote>When you grasp the understanding that the book of your life is already written and filled with beautiful stories, your life will be nothing short of glory.</blockquote>

		  	<p>So often, men get themselves wearied and drowned by their worries and anxiety. So many are depressed by their fear of the future; they are often uncertain how things will unfold in their lives.</p>
		  	<p>However, God’s Word gives us an assurance that the story of our life has already been written, and it is a glorious one.</p>
		  	<p>We are assured by this Word, that we have been predestined, called, justified and glorified, to suit our purpose. Is there anything better to have, than the knowledge of the truth that we have been predestined by God?</p>
		  	<p>When you grasp the understanding that the book of your life is already written and filled with beautiful stories, your life will be nothing short of glory.</p>
		  	<p>Don’t be worried about what your future might hold; our destiny has already been secured by God. It may not seem like it, situations might seem to be acting against us, but God’s Word assures us that everything will work together for our good.</p>
		  	<p>Joseph’s betrayal by his brothers, worked together for his good; his brothers, in an attempt to kill his dreams, not only released him to his place of assignment, but created an opportunity for his dreams to be made real. If they had not betrayed him, he wouldn’t have met the opportunity that got him to the throne.</p>
		  	<p>Jesus betrayal by Judas worked together for His good; if Judas had not betrayed Him, there might have been no judgment, death and resurrection. The betrayal was for good. Before Judas kissed Jesus, Jesus already knew that betrayal was on its way. Verily, it had already been written in the book of His life.</p>
		  	<p>Lazarus sickness was not unto death but the glory of God; it was through the sickness and death of Lazarus that God manifested His glory.</p>
		  	<p>The stories of these fellows were already written beforehand. There had to be a Judas for the story of Jesus to be complete.</p>
		  	<p>Beloved, there might be so many people playing the role of ‘Judas’, and ‘Joseph’s brothers’ in your life. It might seem like you’re hated by all, but cheer up! The haters are only making up the great story of your life.</p>
		  	<p>You don’t need to be worried about anything in life; the trials, challenges and persecutions only merge together to work for your good. You were justified, glorified, called and predestined by God for purpose. Your story has been written already. It’s such a beautiful one! You’re so blessed!</p>
