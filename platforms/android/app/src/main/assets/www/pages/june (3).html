		  	<p><i>Many are the afflictions of the righteous: but the Lord delivereth him out of them all. (Psalms 34:19)</i></p>


		  	<blockquote>There is no affliction that is capable of outlasting a righteous man.</blockquote>

		  	<p>Many Christians, when they are tried in adverse ways, begin to get weakened, and gradually lose their faith; sometimes, they doubt the existence of God, or His power to save.</p>
		  	<p>Many have given up on God, because they cherished the thought that God has given up on them. The reason is—they lack the understanding that the righteous can still be afflicted.</p>
		  	<p>Being born again does not exempt you from trials, tribulations and troubles, but it gives you an advantage over everything. God never promised us a persecution-free life; rather, we are admonished to take heart, for Christ has already overcome. (John 16:33)</p>
		  	<p>A lot of people fail to think before acting; that’s where they falter. When you find yourself being afflicted, understand the purpose of your affliction before making conclusions.</p>
		  	<p>Job was afflicted in every way, but he never resorted to denouncing God, no matter how much he was persuaded. Why? He understood the purpose of his affliction. He knew that it was only a temporal trial to prove his worthiness; he knew that the affliction wasn’t going to break him, but make him. Indeed, his latter days were greater than the former.</p>
		  	<p>Just like Job never embraced the conclusion that God had forsaken him, but chose to understand the purpose of the affliction; we also should understand that the righteous man gets afflicted, just for a Divine Purpose.</p>
		  	<p>Fanny Crosby was a legend, who lost her sight as an infant, but chose to understand God’s purpose . . . She never let her visual impairment affect her service to God, as she accomplished even more than those with earthly sight could ever do.</p>
		  	<p>She once said, “If perfect earthly sight were offered me tomorrow I would not accept it.” She would not accept earthly sight anymore in her lifetime, because she wanted the face of God to be the first she will ever behold. She appreciated her blindness, because through it, she received more spiritual insight.</p>
		  	<p>At a point in her life, she lacked money to pay her rent, and was evicted from her house. She never denounced God amidst such affliction, and just in a moment, a strange man walked up to her and handed her the exact amount of money needed to suit her bills. This led her to write another hymn titled: All the way the savior leads me.</p>
		  	<p>Beloved, God could as well just bless Job as He did in his latter days, without allowing him get afflicted; God could have just provided Fanny Crosby’s bills without letting her be evicted.</p>
		  	<p>But He allowed the afflictions to happen for a purpose; and the duo understood that. It pays to understand that your present affliction is just for a Divine purpose.</p>
		  	<p>If God never allowed Job to be afflicted, and if Fanny never lost her sight and her shelter for a second, the duo might never practically understand God’s goodness.</p>
		  	<p>The most interesting aspect of the scripture today is the assurance that we will always be delivered from all our afflictions. I’m glad it did not say some afflictions, but all of them. In essence, there is no affliction that is capable of outlasting a righteous man.</p>
		  	<p>Just as God delivered Daniel, and Shedrach, Meshach and Abednego from the lion’s den, and fiery furnace respectively, He will always show up in every affliction.</p>
		  	<p>No life has inspired me as much as that of Fanny Crosby; I read her biography, and almost desired to lose my sight. Her attitude to everything has transformed my being. If she had never been afflicted a second, such a powerful testimony may never have existed, and many will miss out on such inspiration.</p>
		  	<p>Cheer up in times of affliction; the generation after needs to be inspired, motivated and lifted by your testimony over affliction.</p>
		  	<p>God could have prevented Lazarus from death, but He allowed him to die, that His glory will be unveiled. God can as well prevent the righteous man from afflictions, but He allows it, so that through it, His power to save and deliver will be fully manifested.</p>
		  	<p>When you understand the purpose of your affliction, you will constantly live above it. There is a purpose for this slight momentary afflictions; it prepares before you, an eternal weight of glory beyond comparison (2 Corinthians 4:17). Be blessed!</p>
