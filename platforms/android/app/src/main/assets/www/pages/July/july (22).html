		  	<p><i>Shew me a token for good; that they which hate me may see it, and be ashamed: because thou, LORD, hast holpen me, and comforted me. (Psalms 86:17)</i></p>

		  	<blockquote>What small men saw as an insult; great men regarded as a challenge.</blockquote>

		  	<p>There is no man that successfully made it to greatness without embracing a challenge. Challenges are not always pleasant; they’re rough and tough phases, which you go through, that brings out the best in you.</p>
		  	<p>Every man has the right to decide what to regard as an insult, and what to embrace as a challenge.</p>
		  	<p>Some years ago, while I was back in high school, something unforgettable happened to me; an event very painful in the short term, yet fruitful in the long term.</p>
		  	<p>I always performed very well in a certain course, Mathematics precisely. I had a good record of excellent grades in this course, however, there was a test which I sat for, but did not perform as well as I did previously.</p>
		  	<p>I still have a clear picture of how everyone gathered around the teacher to enquire about my performance. In response to their query, the teacher boldly declared, “the mighty has fallen!” He was referring to the dramatic declination of my performance.</p>
		  	<p>That night, I flooded my pillows with tears. I wept until my tears could no longer respond to my sorrowful state of mind. As I went to the Lord in prayer, I received a kind of comfort that my heart has never known.</p>
		  	<p>I chose not to be broken by the untamed statement of my lecturer, but to embrace the challenge to prove him wrong. I was determined to prove to everyone that though the mighty may have fallen, she will surely rise with greater might and strength.</p>
		  	<p>Each time I felt weary of studying, I was strengthened by that challenge. Before that event, I was comfortable with my level of performance, but by that challenge, greater potentials in me were unlocked.</p>
		  	<p><b>You may never understand how much you can do, until you are challenged in a painful way.</b></p>
		  	<p>In the scripture above, David prayed God for a token of good, not for any other reason, but to put his enemies to shame. His enemies must have degraded, humiliated, and maltreated him. However, David chose not to regard their actions as an insult, but to embrace the challenge of proving them wrong.</p>
		  	<p>I could have accepted the words of my teacher. I could have admitted that I have really fallen. I could have thought that I was not good enough. But there’s a kind of comfort the Lord gives, that makes you regard insults not as they really are, but as challenges to do greater.</p>
		  	<p>What was said about Jesus? <i> Can anything good come out of Narazeth? Is he not the carpenter’s son? </i></p>
		  	<p>What was said to David when he showed up to battle Goliath? <i> You are only a youth... Who have you left the sheep for?</i></p>
		  	<p>Degradation is mutual between the great and the small, the only difference is how they’ve handled it. What small men saw as an insult; great men regarded as a challenge.</p>
		  	<p>Beloved, if only you can choose not to be discouraged but challenged, the records will be re-written by your deeds. People might have looked at your present state and disqualified you by their speech, but take it as a challenge to prove them wrong.</p>
		  	<p>The best you could do for your critics is not to be discouraged by them, but to be challenged by their judgment. </p>
		  	<p>I thank God for my critics; I bless God for my enemies. If it had not been for their untamed actions, I might never have been challenged to unlock the great potentials that rested within me.</p>
		  	<p>Everything happens for a purpose: don’t be insulted; be challenged. You’re so blessed!</p>
