		  	<p><i>Delight thyself also in the Lord: and he shall give thee the desires of thine heart. (Psalms 37:4)</i></p>

		  	<blockquote>So many things happen when we delight ourselves in the Spirit. Worship is the only thing that can transform an atmosphere of sorrow, to a greater realm of joy. </blockquote>

		  	<p>A desire is different from a necessity. Necessities are prioritized over mere wants or desires.</p>
		  	<p>A man has basic needs of shelter, food, water, clothes, amongst others. When these needs are met, then he might want to be mobile, and then purchase a car. For some other form of comfort, he might then purchase some basic gadgets.</p>
		  	<p>Most often, we really don’t have desires until all our needs are met. Thoughts on changing our wardrobe, upgrading our gadgets, the class of car to drive, the type of house to live in, and other forms of luxury are only ushered in to our minds, when we are already in possession of something basic.</p>
		  	<p>I’m glad this scripture does not leave a promise of merely fulfilling our needs, but our desires also. We just need to delight in the Lord. It is written: </p>
		  	<p><i>The Lord is my shepherd; I shall not want. (Psalm 23:1)</i></p>
		  	<p>This scripture implies that all our needs are already met, and now God is in the mood to fulfill our desires and wants. Again it is written:</p>
		  	<p><i>He will fulfil the desire of them that fear him... (Psalms 145:19)</i></p>
		  	<p>Beloved, it is an error for us to still be in the place of lacking necessities. No one can be a better shepherd than God. If He leads us, He will also ensure that we not only have basic necessities, but our desires as well.</p>
		  	<p>The Lord is set to fulfil the desires of the righteous! Only let him lead you. Abide in Him always; Delight yourself in the Word of God, and in Spirit.</p>
		  	<p>However, do not rejoice in the fact that we are assured of having all our desires met, but in the goodness of God. I am not in love with God because I desire to be more prosperous, but because He first showed me such love, salvation and grace that swept me off my feet.</p>
		  	<p>Beloved, we should delight in the Lord no matter what situation we find ourselves in. There is no better way to start off a day, than meditating, declaring rhema and rejoicing (with songs) in the Holy Spirit.</p>
		  	<p>Let the Words and promises of God give you joy always. Minister to the Lord constantly in worship, praise and thanksgiving. The best way to have your desires met is by rejoicing and worshipping in Spirit.</p>
		  	<p>So many things happen when we delight ourselves in the Spirit. Men are just so blind to see that. There were times when my Spirit was transposed into higher spiritual realms that control the earth, these were all at times of worship and delight in the Spirit.</p>
		  	<p>Worship is the only thing that can transform an atmosphere of sorrow, to a greater realm of joy. Never start a day without meditation and worship. Delight in the Lord always! Be blessed!</p>
