		  	<p><i>So then faith cometh by hearing, and hearing by the word of God. (Romans 10:17)</i></p>
		 

		  	<blockquote>Faith comes by hearing: people can never have faith beyond what they’ve heard. </blockquote>

		  	<p>Let me paraphrase this scripture—faith comes by hearing the Word of God. In essence, the origin of faith is not just the Word of God, but hearing the Word of God.</p>
		  	<p>In order for the Word of God to be heard, it has to have been spoken, either by the hearer or someone else.</p>
		  	<p>When you speak, not only those under the sound of your voice hear you, but you hear yourself as well. Therefore, in order for faith to come, the Word of God has to be heard, and in order for it to be heard, it has to be spoken.</p>
		  	<p>Previously, we studied about speaking the Word of God, and its importance. Now, we’d realise that it is also a prerequisite to hearing the Word of God.</p>
		  	<p>We studied about the origin of faith, making reference to this particular scripture. We concluded by saying that the origin of faith is the Word of God; now we will go deeper to say that faith does not just originate from the Word, but from hearing the Word of God.</p>
		  	<p>So often, we try to persuade people to have faith in God, without actually speaking the Word of God to them. What we often fail to realise is that without them hearing the Word of God, they can never have faith in God.</p>
		  	<p>Don’t expect to see an act of faith from someone who has not really heard the Word of God; people can never have faith beyond what they’ve heard.</p>
		  	<p>What you hear influences the course and direction of your faith. If you hear more of the devil’s voice than you hear God’s Word, you will have more faith in the devil than you have in God.</p>
		  	<p>It is crazy that a lot of Christians complain about their inability to hear God, but the same people are so quick to quote what the enemy said to them.</p>
		  	<p>There are instances when people were diagnosed with terminal illnesses; they never heard God, but they heard the enemy so clearly, assuring them that they will die soon. At several other instances, people told me that the devil told them so and so. However, when I ask such people what God said, they go dumb.</p>
		  	<p>Why will you meditate more on what the devil said than what God said, and expect to have faith in God? Why will you confess more of the devils words than the Word of God, and expect to overcome?</p>
		  	<p>What you confess is what you hear; Charles Capps once said that before anyone else hears your voice, you must have heard yourself. In essence, when you confess God’s Word always, you hear it first, and it releases faith in your spirit.</p>
		  	<p>Likewise, when you confess the devils words, you hear it, and it releases more fear in your spirit.</p>
		  	<p>If you want to hear more of God’s Word, speak more of His Words. If you need a friend or family to have faith, ensure you tell them the Word, and let them hear it.</p>
		  	<p>When the Word of God is heard, faith has no choice but to be released. Devote quality time to speaking and hearing His Word. Be blessed!</p>
