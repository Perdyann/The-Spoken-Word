		  	<p><i>Being confident of this very thing, that he which hath begun a good work in you will perform it until the day of Jesus Christ: (Philippians 1:6)</i></p>

		  	<blockquote>When men start a journey with you, they might forsake you if the going gets tough; but when God starts a journey with you, He will be there till the very end. </blockquote>

		  	<p>Sometime ago, God spoke a Word about launching me into a new season; in no time, I realized that I had stepped into that season. I had not finished celebrating my release into that season, when the storms and troubles of life began to roar ferociously against me.</p>
		  	<p>I could never think of returning to the previous season of my life, and at that point, the tough troubles of the present season threatened my future. It seemed like I had just approached a dead-end. As I pondered on the way out, an uplifting thought flooded my mind—He wouldn’t bring me this far just to leave me stranded —</p>
		  	<p>And to think of it, will God really see you through your childhood, youthful days, and then desert you now? No!</p>
		  	<p><i>He has said, “I will never leave thee, nor forsake thee.” (Hebrews 13:5)</i></p>
		  	<p>When men start a journey with you, they might forsake you if the going gets tough; but when God starts a journey with you, He will be there till the very end.</p>
		  	<p>God did not redeem the Israelites from the captivity in Egypt, just to leave them stranded in the desert. He sure was with them till the very end.</p>
		  	<p>God did not command Abraham to leave his fatherland to an unknown land, just to get him stranded. He was with him till the end.</p>
		  	<p>Jesus did not call Peter to walk on water with him, just to leave him sinking after a while; when Peter began to sink, Jesus stretched His hands and held him up. (Matthew 14:31)</p>
		  	<p>Quite alright, the Israelites faced trials in the desert; Abraham was tested in the land God led him to; Peter was terrified by the roaring storms; but God never deserted them half-way through their journeys.</p>
		  	<p>Even though they encountered various challenges, God was there to see them through it all. What is the point? God will never lead you to a realm where His grace cannot encompass.</p>
		  	<p>As the scripture rightly states, God, who has begun something great in our lives, will surely complete it. He does not retire; He does not do things half-way.</p>
		  	<p>Just like Peter, are you caught up in the middle of the waters God called you into? The Holy Spirit is right there; allow Him to hold you up above the storms of life.</p>
		  	<p>Just like the Israelites, do you find yourself lacking water and food in the wilderness God brought you to? The Holy Spirit is right there to give you sufficient water and manna till you approach the promise land.</p>
		  	<p>Just like Abraham, do you find yourself in a strange land, trying to make ends meet? Cheer up! Before God brought you there, He had already opened doors for you. He will never lead you out of your country just to forsake you later on.</p>
		  	<p>The only time you might indeed be stranded in a place, is when you led yourself to that place of your own accord; the only time you might really be stranded on a project, is when you started it of your own accord. A man that releases himself will sustain himself.</p>
		  	<p>However, God is a master strategist; if you admit that all your life, you have been directed by your own will and desire, and you make a decision to yield to the Holy Spirit, He will still make a message out of your mess.</p>
		  	<p>Look back on your life; think about how God redeemed you in the past, and provided for you through unexpected means. Do you really think He will retire now?</p>
		  	<p>The God that provided the first drop of water for you will not stop, until you have an overflowing ocean; the God that gave you a bite of bread will not stop giving, until the entire bread is stuffed in your mouth.</p>
		  	<p>Finally brethren, as it is said, <i> “Being confident of this very thing ...”</i></p>
		  	<p>Verily, if there’s one thing to be confident about, it is, God will never start something, which He cannot finish. Be blessed!</p>
