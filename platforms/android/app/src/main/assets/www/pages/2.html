		  <div class="panel-body">

		  	<i style="text-align:justify">“Behold, I will do a new thing; now it shall spring forth; shall ye not know it? I will even make a way in the wilderness, and rivers in the desert.” (Isaiah 43:19)</i>
		  	<blockquote style="text-align:justify">Never expect a change in life if your faith is easily weakened by situations . . . It takes a man of uncompromising faith to be outstanding.</blockquote>

		  	<p style="text-align:justify">Could there possibly be a way in the wilderness? Could there possibly be rivers in a desert? I don’t think so. The lack of water is what makes it a desert after all. A desert is characterized by its dryness. God   was   not   in   any way mistaking when He gave this Word to Isaiah . . . He was simply trying to give light to the truth that THERE IS POSSIBILITY IN IMPOSSIBILITY . . . There is a way in ‘No way’ . . . There is abundance in lack . . . There is knowledge in folly . . . There is hope in hopelessness . . . There is water in my desert! </p>
		  	<p style="text-align:justify">The genuine source of anything is only discovered by relentless people who are never willing to give up.</p>
		  	<p style="text-align:justify">Do you recall exactly what happened when Jesus healed the paralyzed man in Capernaum? (Mark 2:1-12) The bible records that there was NO ROOM to contain them . . . There was such a pressing crowd, that the doors were not enough to let people in.</p>
		  	<p style="text-align:justify">Now, seeing the situation, many people must have turned back and made their way home saying, “Perhaps today is not just my day” So many others may have waited for hours, and eventually given up. Yet, these very ones walked into the scene . . . They told them, “There’s NO ROOM for you . . .” They replied, “I can’t have no for an answer.”</p>
		  	<p style="text-align:justify">They walked to the doors . . . Then they were told, “the doors are too congested . . . there are not enough doors to let everyone in . . . No space!” Then, relentlessly, they headed to the windows . . . It was already full.</p>
		  	<p style="text-align:justify">At this juncture, people began to turn back . . . But all of a sudden, due to the unwillingness of these determined fellows to leave empty handed, they began to trust God for a way in their wilderness, and a river in their desert. That was where the wisdom of God took over them, and they ended up in the roof; Digging with hope and determination, until they were able to let down their paralyzed friend.</p>
		  	<p style="text-align:justify">When Jesus saw him, the situations of all other people were halted for his sake . . . At this juncture, the bible ceased to speak of the pressing crowd. The focus was drifted from the multitude to one man.</p>
		  	<p style="text-align:justify">The only reason why they could get God’s attention was faith. The bible says, “When Jesus saw their faith, he said . . .” Beloved, did you notice that even before Jesus saw them, He saw their faith. What God sees is your faith, not your pity face!</p>
		  	<p style="text-align:justify">Instantly, God forgave his sins and healed him. Beloved, there was a price: They left their comfort zones and took a walk of faith.</p>
		  	<p style="text-align:justify">So many must have been comfortably standing in the queue endlessly, Nonetheless, the provocation of faith led some to break protocols, principles, and procedures, in order to get the attention of Jesus by all means.</p>
		  	<p style="text-align:justify">There comes a time in life where the unnecessary delay of things will provoke you to rise from your comfort zone for a change. Never expect a change if you are not determined . . . Never expect a change if you would easily turn back by the sight of things . . . Never expect a change in life if your faith is easily weakened by situations . . . It takes a man of uncompromising faith to be outstanding.</p>
		  	<p style="text-align:justify">The lady with the issue of blood had tolerated shame for long enough . . . There was just this one opportunity when she sighted a change. She saw healing in the garment of Jesus. Beloved, the current situation around her was not pleasant at all. The crowd was tight and pushing. But you know what . . . She had an uncompromising faith.</p>
		  	<p style="text-align:justify">She left her comfort zone . . . she pushed and pushed . . . she squeezed with the very last bit of the strength left in her, until she grasped her healing from the garment of Jesus.</p>
		  	<p style="text-align:justify">God always fulfils the counsel of His messengers. The friends of the paralyzed man must have said, “We are not going anywhere if our friend isn’t healed today . . .” The woman with the issue of blood must have said, “I am not leaving the presence of God with the shame I brought in.”</p>
		  	<p style="text-align:justify">Beloved, it is time for you to say something, and deliberately step out of your comfort zone. You have been in your situation for too long. Rise up for a change. Even when the Doctors say “no way”, always remember that Jesus first said, “I AM THE WAY”</p>
		  	<p style="text-align:justify">What am I saying? Beloved, even when there is no way . . . I mean NO WAY! God is the WAY!</p>
		  	<p style="text-align:justify">When the doors are full, don’t give up; Try the windows. When the window is choked up, don’t turn back; begin to dig the roof. When the crowd is tight, don’t be sluggish . . . PUSH</p>
		  	<p style="text-align:justify">Get out of your comfort zone . . . for even when all other ways are blocked . . . God stands! He is the way. There cannot be “no way” when there is “God”. Be blessed!</p>
