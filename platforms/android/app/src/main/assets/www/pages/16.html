		  	<p><i>In the spring, when kings go forth to battle, David sent Joab with his servants and all Israel, and they ravaged the Ammonites [country] and besieged Rabbah. But David remained in Jerusalem.</i></p>
		  	<p><i>One evening David arose from his couch and was walking on the roof of the king’s house, when from there he saw a woman bathing; and she was very lovely to behold. (2 Samuel 11:1-2)</i></p>
		  	

		  	<blockquote>There is just a little retirement, a little folding of arms, and a little sleep that could hinder one’s destiny.</blockquote>

		  	<p>The fall of David was hidden in his negligence to duty, at a wrong season. His fall is defined by his insensitivity to the seasons. Notice how he met Bathsheba. In a season when Kings usually go for assignment, David decided to rest.</p>
		  	<p>It pays a lot to do the right thing at the right time. This was not just any other time of the year, but a time when Kings battled for victory.</p>
		  	<p>There is nothing wrong with resting in itself, but resting at the wrong season, when you ought to be working. We all take annual leave from work, paid holidays, amongst others; even these have their seasons and time. David’s only mistake was retiring at a wrong season.</p>
		  	<p>There is just a little retirement, a little folding of arms, and a little sleep that could hinder one’s destiny. Like never before, it was a time to be alert. If you study further, you’d realize that this sleep had drastic repercussions on him. It is written,</p>
		  	<p><i>“Yet a little sleep, a little slumber, a little folding of the hands to lie down and sleep — So will your poverty come like a robber or one who travels [with slowly but surely approaching steps] and your want like an armed man [making you helpless].” (Proverbs 6:10-11 & 24:33-34).</i></p>
		  	<p>If only David was sensitive to the season, all these wouldn’t have happened.</p>
		  	<p>Beloved, be sensitive to the season you are in. There are seasons when the Holy Spirit instructs you to fast and pray. There are seasons when the Lord gives specific instructions. Endeavor to be sensitive enough to hearken, and also yield yourself to service.</p>
		  	<p>When Jesus drove many out of the temple after the triumphant entry. From what He said, it is obvious that the people were not sensitive to the season of visitation.</p>
		  	<p><i>“And shall lay thee even with the ground, and thy children within thee; and they shall not leave in thee one stone upon another; because thou knewest not the time of thy visitation.” (Luke 19:44)</i></p>
		  	<p>You’ve got to be sensitive enough to know the season you are in, and to walk in it. The bible says that there is time for everything! (Ecclesiastes 3:1). It is very wrong to stay behind when the Kings are at war; it’s not right to sleep when it is time to act. The enemy remains at watch, seeking such an opportunity, when you sleep at the wrong time, in order to attack your destiny. Beloved, be alert!</p>
