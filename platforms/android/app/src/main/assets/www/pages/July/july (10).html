		  	<p><i>And the LORD said unto Gideon, The people that are with thee are too many for me to give the Midianites into their hands, lest Israel vaunt themselves against me, saying, Mine own hand hath saved me. (Judges 7:2)</i></p>
		

		  	<blockquote>You can achieve big visions and projects with less than you think you need. </blockquote>

		  	<p>The LORD had assured Gideon, that He will give the Midianites into the hands of the Israelites; Gideon received the Word, and gathered together an army of thirty two thousand able bodied men (32000) in preparation for the war against the Midianites.</p>
		  	<p>The LORD did not encourage Gideon to gather more men, but to send home some of those whom he already gathered.</p>
		  	<p>To think of it, when you are preparing for a serious warfare, you ensure that you get as equipped as you possibly can, and gather as many armed men as you can. It is generally believed that the stronger army takes over the battle.</p>
		  	<p>However, when God is involved, that’s not the case; With God on your side, you don’t need anything else to be assured of victory.</p>
		  	<p>The LORD will not share his glory with any man. Verily, if the Israelites had a mighty army, their victory will be attributed to the strength of their army, and not God</p>
		  	<p>Notice, after Gideon had reduced the number of the army to ten thousand men, by sending home the fearful, God still said regarded them as being too much. They had to be screened, and only three hundred qualified to proceed.</p>
		  	<p>Wining a battle with thirty two thousand, or even ten thousand able bodied men, will be regarded as no big deal; everyone will easily accredit the size and strength of the army for the victory gained. However, when a battle as serious as that against the Midianites is to be fought and won by only three hundred men, it will be regarded as a miracle.</p>
		  	<p>The Lord delights in handling impossible situation; when some things happen, we regard them as normal and ordinary occurrences, but when some other things happen, we know for sure that it must have been God.</p>
		  	<p>Defeating the Midianites with only three hundred men was something that can only be achieved when God is involved.</p>
		  	<p>Beloved, here’s the point; when you get God involved in your affairs, you will accomplish the impossible. When you make God in charge of your life, you wouldn’t need so much to accomplish mighty goals.</p>
		  	<p>Gideon thought he needed thirty two thousand men, in order to gain victory, but eventually, only three hundred men were used.</p>
		  	<p>Everyone thought that a truck of loaves and fish was what was needed to feed the multitude of four thousand men, but with only seven loaves and few fish, they were all satisfied.</p>
		  	<p>Verily, you can achieve big visions and projects with less than you think you need.</p>
		  	<p>As long as you have the Holy Spirit, your success is certain; everything your mind can envisage is possible. Don’t compare your present resources to the project or vision ahead.</p>
		  	<p>With the Lord, you can accomplish everything without anything; trust in the Lord and no one else. Be blessed!</p>
