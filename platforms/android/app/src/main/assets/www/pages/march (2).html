		  	<p><i>And the king said, Who is in the court? Now Haman was come into the outward court of the king’s house, to speak unto the king to hang Mordecai on the gallows that he had prepared for him.</i></p>
		  	<p><i>So they hanged Haman on the gallows that he had prepared for Mordecai. Then was the king’s wrath pacified. (Esther 6:4 & 7:10)</i></p>


		  	<blockquote>The weapons which your enemies carefully fashioned against you, will continually speak against them.</blockquote>

		  	<p>I am astonished at the way God always turns things around in our favor. Just when the enemy thinks that he has finally dug up our graves, the Lord ensures that he is buried in that same grave.</p>
		  	<p>When Haman was engrossed with his preparation of gallows, he hadn’t the least idea, that he will be hung in it. Indeed, he was hung on the gallows which he, in all efforts, prepared for Mordecai; Mordecai was promoted in place of Haman </p>
		  	<p>When Goliath was sharpening his sword that morning, he hadn’t the least idea that the sword will slay him. He was killed with the weapon which he brought to use against David; David was celebrated in place of Goliath. (1 Samuel 17:51)</p>
		  	<p>In the case of Shedrach, Meshach and Abednego, the very people that prepared and heated up the fiery furnace, were killed by it, but they, for whom the furnace had been prepared, came out of it, without a strand of hair being consumed. (Daniel 3:11-30)</p>
		  	<p>The same people who accused Daniel, and casted him into the den of lions to be slain, were themselves slain by those lions, after Daniel came out un-harmed (Daniel 6:11-24)</p>
		  	<p>When Joseph’s brothers threw him in a pit, and sold him, they thought they were killing his dreams; little did they know that they were releasing him to his greatness, just in due time.</p>
		  	<p>When they crucified the King of Glory, they thought they were killing him; little did they know that in dying, He destroyed our death, and by rising, our lives were restored. As it is written:</p>
		  	<p><i>“Which none of the princes of this world knew: for had they known it, they would not have crucified the Lord of glory.” (1 Corinthians 2:8)</i></p>
		  	<p>Had Mordecai known, he wouldn’t have made the gallows so deep... Had the accusers known, they wouldn’t have thrown Daniel into the lion’s den... Had Goliath known, he wouldn’t have underestimated David... Had Nebuchadnezzar known, he wouldn’t have condemned the three men into the fire... Had Joseph’s brothers known, they wouldn’t have sold him... Had they princes of the world known, they would have prevented the crucifixion of Jesus.</p>
		  	<p>Beloved, our enemies are ignorantly preparing their own trap!</p>
		  	<p>I love the exchange of positions! When the enemy tries to exalt himself at your expense, there’d surely be a swap!</p>
		  	<p>Isn’t it amazing how the LORD swallows up the enemy in their own traps, weapons and devices, which they prepared, to use against us?</p>
		  	<p>Beloved, when you discover that your enemies are on a trap-project, to consume you, rejoice and praise God, for indeed, they have prepared their own ditch.</p>
		  	<p>Have this consciousness always, it is a mindset; “no weapon fashioned against you shall prosper.” (Isaiah 54:17) Indeed, the weapons which your enemies carefully fashioned against you, will continually speak against them. Be blessed!</p>
