		  	<p><i>Give not that which is holy unto the dogs, neither cast ye your pearls before swine, lest they trample them under their feet, and turn again and rend you. (Matthew 7:6)</i></p>

		  	<blockquote>Not everyone deserves direct access into your private life</blockquote>

		  	<p>There are various things in the life of a man which are very much valued as though they are pearls. Some people regard their visions as precious pearls, and others their time. To some others, the pearl of inestimable value is their dream, attention, or perhaps wealth.</p>
		  	<p>These are the very things that make our lives so valuable, and worth living. However, it matters a lot who you give direct access into your cherished place.</p>
		  	<p>Not everyone celebrates your vision, purpose and destiny the way you do. Not everyone is capable of seeing the dreams you see. Thus when they don’t see and understand what you see, they will seek to terminate your dream. There are people with a specific mandate to devalue your pearl.</p>
		  	<p>Joseph was one of a kind. He had such great dreams, which gradually unveiled the glory of his latter days. He could joke with anything else, but not his dreams and visions. This was his precious pearl!</p>
		  	<p>However, as he grew in vision, he sought people to support him. This led him to share his dreams and visions with his own brothers. Irony is birthed from the fact that rather than support, they rendered hatred and vain destruction.</p>
		  	<p><i>And Joseph dreamed a dream, and he told it his brethren: and they hated him yet the more. (Genesis 37:5)</i></p>
		  	<p>Telling wrong people your dreams will only birth hatred and not support. Verily, the hatred of his brothers was only stirred up when he told them his dream.</p>
		  	<p>Indeed, Joseph’s brothers were not worthy to partake in his vision. They really didn’t deserve his time and attention. When you share your visions with the wrong people, rather than render support, they’d try to kill you!</p>
		  	<p>Don’t give your pearls to pigs (wrong people); they’d only trample upon it! Not everyone deserves your time, attention, focus, dreams and vision. Indeed, not everyone deserves to know what God told you in private. Share your visions with people that encourage it.</p>
		  	<p><i>For, lo, as soon as the voice of thy salutation sounded in mine ears, the babe leaped in my womb for joy. (Luke 1:44)</i></p>
		  	<p>Open your doors only to people that make your baby (vision) to leap. A man of vision should mingle with visionary people. When Mary was pregnant with Jesus, she didn’t seek to visit just anyone, but Elizabeth (a fellow pregnant woman). Only pregnant women can understand certain issues. It’s not everyone that deserved to mingle with Mary, but only people who experienced what she did.</p>
		  	<p>Samson’s precious pearl was his hair, which gave him strength. What he failed to realize is this truth—“Not everyone deserves direct access into your private life.”—Delilah didn’t deserve to know the source of his strength!</p>
		  	<p>Beloved, we need to be sensitive about who we discuss personal issues with. We need to be sensitive about the people we give direct access into specific parts of our Ministry. We need to be sensitive about the people whom we share our dreams, visions and mysteries with. Some people are only in your life to let you down.</p>
		  	<p>Don’t choose your friends by your self-will; allow your vision to select your friends. As important as our pearls are, we must understand that they can be devalued when they are given to pigs (wrong people). Be blessed!</p>
