		  <div class="panel-body" style="text-align:justify">


		  	<p><i>Above all, taking the shield of faith, wherewith ye shall be able to quench all the fiery darts of the wicked. (Ephesians 6:16)</i></p>
		 
		  	<blockquote>Faith nullifies every evil projection of the enemy. </blockquote>

		  	<p>We have studied the importance of having a foundation of truth, putting on the breastplate of righteousness, and then the gospel of peace; but something is amazing about the next armor pronounced.</p>
		  	<p>Did you notice the use of the term, “Above all”, in introducing the shield of faith? What this implies is that faith is the most important of all armors listed so far.</p>
		  	<p>Even if all armours are put on, and the shield of faith is not taken, you’d still remain prone to getting burnt by the fiery darts of the enemy.</p>
		  	<p>Truth was not described as being more important than everything else, even though it is good; righteousness was not described as being more important than everything else, even though it is good; the gospel of peace was not referred to as the most important, even though it is good. But Faith!</p>
		  	<p>Why faith? Righteousness is by faith; without faith, the gospel of peace will not be profitable to us; what foundation of truth can be laid without faith? That’s exactly why faith is referred to as being above all. It takes faith to actually put on all other armours.</p>
		  	<p>We do not battle against flesh and blood, but wickedness in high places; so many fiery darts are projected against us on a daily basis. Faith is that weapon, which quenches, and makes a nonentity of the darts of the enemy.</p>
		  	<p>The reason why a lot of people are still struggling with demonic attack is because they have not taken up the shield of faith; so many people are limited in every way, by demonic strongholds simply because they have not taken up the shield of faith.</p>
		  	<p>When faith is brought into the picture, the height of the devils struggles to get you down will yield no result. Faith nullifies every evil projection of the enemy.</p>
		  	<p>Men, who are still on top of the game, are those, who are holding on to their shield of faith.</p>
		  	<p>Without faith, it is impossible to please God; without faith, it is impossible to access God’s Divine provision for you; without faith, it is impossible to profit from the Word of God; without faith, an average Christian will remain vulnerable to the attacks of the enemy.</p>
		  	<p>You cannot keep praying to God to help you quench the fiery darts of the enemy; God has already done all that He will do, the responsibility of putting the enemy in his place is now in your hands.</p>
		  	<p>The fiery darts of the wicked cannot be quenched by your tears, but faith. Stop crying to God in ignorance, He’s already defeated the enemy long time ago; just step above him in faith.</p>
		  	<p>Above all (above every other weapon you might think of taking for a battle), take your shield of faith. Be blessed!</p>
