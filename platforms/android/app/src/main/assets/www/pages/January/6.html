		  	<p><i>“When men are cast down, then thou shalt say, There is lifting up . . .” (Job 22:29)</i></p>
		  	

		  	<blockquote>Determine not to act as a mere man, because your actions and response to certain things in life, determine your stand.</blockquote>

		  	<p>In the above scripture, there is a sort of categorization, that distinctly portrays two different kinds of specie . . . we’ve got men, and likewise, you. Have you ever wondered thus, “but I am also a man?”</p>
		  	<p>The truth is, as long as you are born-again, and you live God’s kind of Life, you have ceased to be ordinary. The way we define things in the Higher Realm is very different! The people referred to as men in the above scripture are those, who are merely resident in the earthly realm; but when the scripture contrastingly says, “you shall say . . .”, what is being referred to is extra-ordinary men, who dwell in God’s realm of life.</p>
		  	<p>The response and definitions of a mere man to situations is very different from that of the Sons of God. When you are resident in the God’s realm of life, even nature begins to act in your favor, thus, you cease to be subject to natural rules and principles.</p>
		  	<p>At this juncture, your wealth is no longer determined by the economy of this world, but by the nature of Zion. That is why, even when men are ignorantly complaining of a casting down, you shall be experiencing a lifting up. Beloved, decide not to be a mere man! Choose to be different and extra-ordinary.</p>
		  	<p><i>When Jesus came into the coasts of Caesarea Philippi, he asked his disciples, saying, Whom do men say that I the Son of man am?</i></p>
		  	<p><i>And they said, Some say that thou art John the Baptist: some, Elias; and others, Jeremias, or one of the prophets.
			He saith unto them, But whom say ye that I am?</i></p>
		  	<p><i>And Simon Peter answered and said, Thou art the Christ, the Son of the living God. (Matthew 16:13-16)</i></p>
		  	<p>Did you notice what ensued between Jesus and Peter? Jesus deliberately asked, “Who do people say I am?” The disciples gave Him the definition of mere men, when they said, “some say that you are John the Baptist . . . others say . . .” then Jesus went further to ask, “But who do you say I am?” It was only then that Peter spoke out of knowledge and told Him the truth—Thou art Christ, the Son of the Living God.</p>
		  	<p>This is obviously because Peter saw Jesus from a different perspective from other people. Isn’t it obvious that we are different from the crowd? Our definitions to situations are very different. We see things differently, and thus we respond and speak differently.</p>
		  	<p>Have this consciousness always—You are not ordinary! When mere men encounter challenges in life and choose to fret, complain and flee; you, determine to stand out and make some powerful decrees from your position of Authority.</p>
		  	<p>A lot of scriptures don’t actually refer to just anybody . . . It is for selected people . . . Men who operate in God’s realm of life. It is written,</p>
		  	<p><i>“Thou shalt also decree a thing, and it shall be established unto thee: and the light shall shine upon thy ways.” (Job 22:28).</i></p>
		  	<p>Indeed, not everyone can easily key into this, because not everyone sees it from the same perspective. Mere men would say, “I have decreed several things, but none of it was established unto me.” But extra-ordinary men who have received this as Rhema would boldly begin to make powerful decrees in faith, and so shall it be unto them.</p>
		  	<p>If there’s one thing you must do today, ponder for a while . . . From what perspective do you view things . . . the earthly realm or from God’s realm? Do you respond to situations as mere men do, or from the dimension of the supernatural?</p>
		  	<p>Determine not to act as a mere man, because your actions and response to certain things in life, determine your stand. Move with this consciousness from today, you are not a mere man . . . You operate from a different realm of life. Amen!</p>
