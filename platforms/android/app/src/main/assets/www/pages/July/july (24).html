		  	<p><i>Come unto me, all ye that labour and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest. (Matthew 11:28)</i></p>
		 

		  	<blockquote>Until you learn to trust and depend totally on God, you will constantly be caught up in ill situations. </blockquote>

		  	<p>When it seems like the burdens of life have found their resting place on your shoulder; when it is obvious that you cannot bear the weight of such burdens all alone; when you’ve turned around in search of something to lean on and found none; just know that God is dependable.</p>
		  	<p>Your most trusted friends and confidants might not be willing to help you sort out some burdens. They might not be there when you need them most.</p>
		  	<p>The arm of flesh is so unreliable; the economy of the world is so undependable; your life-insurance is not worth putting your hope in; there is not one person or aspect of the world, that you can put your trust in, and be safe.</p>
		  	<p>However, in all these, God remains dependable.</p>
		  	<p>He is the only one we can depend on to feed a multitude of five thousand groups, when we’ve got nothing but five loaves and two fish. He is the only one we can depend on to complete a massive project, when we have nothing, but a few pennies.</p>
		  	<p>He is the only one we can depend on to calm the storms of life by His Words, when they rage against us, and cover our boats. He is the only one we can depend on to reestablish peace in our homes of crises.</p>
		  	<p>He is the only one we can depend on to breathe life on the dead aspects of our businesses, and affairs.</p>
		  	<p>Beloved, you might have gone helter skelter in search of help; you might have sought peace in many wrong places; you might have labored painfully, but reaped nothing; you might have struggled endlessly to no avail.</p>
		  	<p>Until you learn to trust and depend totally on God, you will constantly be caught up in ill situations. Why insist on tackling the issues of life by your human effort, when God has released His Divine ability to you?</p>
		  	<p>Tonight, there is a call specifically to you. God is calling you out of your state of heaviness, to find true rest in him. Who else can ever tell us to cast our anxieties on him for he cares? Who else is ever willing to bear your entire burdens on his shoulder?</p>
		  	<p>Beloved, in a world of an unstable economy, unreliable system, and the unfolding of various unprecedented ill circumstances, God remains dependable.</p>
		  	<p>Are you looking for that basket where you could safely lay all your eggs, and have them well secured? God is dependable!</p>
		  	<p>The earlier we stop relying on our human knowledge, strength, ability and might, and start depending on God, the better it gets for us. Stop confiding in men, who are prone to failure, look unto God, who remains the author and finisher of your success.</p>
		  	<p>God is all you need to be guaranteed a successful and fulfilled life. Be blessed!</p>
