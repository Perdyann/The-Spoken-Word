		  	<p><i>I can do all things through Christ which strengtheneth me.(Philippians 413)</i></p>


		  	<blockquote>You can do much more than you think you can; only substitute your fear with faith. </blockquote>

		  	<p>Life is filled with various tasks... just when we think that we are done with one big task, a greater task is posed ahead of us to accomplish within a limited time.</p>
		  	<p>So often, the magnitude of these tasks implants fear in the heart of many. Only a few are able to handle tasks with faith. This keeps me wondering, “is the task too much for us to handle?”</p>
		  	<p>What meaning do we actually make from this scripture — <i> “Ye are of God, little children, and have overcome them: because greater is he that is in you, than he that is in the world.” (1 John 4:4)</i> - ? </p>
		  	<p>If indeed what is inside of us is greater than anything in the world, then it must be obvious that we are greater than the greatest task that exists in the world. In this note, I believe that tasks should be handled with faith and not fear.</p>
		  	<p>Don’t fret over anything that is not as great as you are. David had enough courage to stand against Goliath, not because his physique was well built, but because his faith was well stirred. He understood that whatsoever might be embedded in his little body is much greater than Goliath and any other task he could ever encounter in the world put together.</p>
		  	<p>Beloved, just like David to Goliath; the giant inside of you is greater than the physical giant you can see.</p>
		  	<p>The Word for today, Philippians 4:13, gives us an assurance that we can really do all things. Notice it did not quote ‘some things’, but ‘all things’. In essence, by the strength we receive from Christ, nothing should remain undone. You can do much more than you think you can; only substitute your fear with faith.</p>
		  	<p>The only reason why we start projects, tasks and assignment, but cannot complete it is fear. When you understand by faith, that the Holy Spirit lives and functions in you, there will be no task left unaccomplished.</p>
		  	<p>What is that mountain laid before you? Who is that giant standing ahead of you? What is that bold step you have been too scared to take? This is the time to be courageous. Have faith! You can do all things through Christ.</p>
		  	<p>What greater Spirit can occupy the body of a man? Since the Holy Spirit is resident and functional in us, there is absolutely nothing that remains impossible to us. Henceforth, have this mindset in you—There is nothing you cannot do! You can do all things — Yes... you can. Be blessed!</p>
