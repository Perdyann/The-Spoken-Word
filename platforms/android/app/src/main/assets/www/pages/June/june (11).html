		  	<p><i>Be not overcome of evil, but overcome evil with good. (Romans 12:21)</i></p>
		


		  	<blockquote>You will never know how to overcome evil, until you learn to love against all odds. </blockquote>

		  	<p>Some versions quote, “Don’t let evil defeat you...” How true! Rather than being defeated by evil, overcome it. Today, we are going to understand how we can overcome the most persisting evil.</p>
		  	<p>Some companions cling unto you, to see to it that you become everything God wants you to be. Such people will support you in every way they can; they are in your life, not just to receive from you, but to give to you. Their love for you is selfless and genuine.</p>
		  	<p>However, at some other seasons, we encounter people who deliberately try in every way, to drain us of every bit of value and gifts we have. It is obvious that these people have very evil intentions towards us.</p>
		  	<p>Sometimes, in response to the good deeds of people, we gratefully act well; but in response to the evil intentions of others, we unknowingly act even more evil than they. Many, in an attempt to overcome evil, become more evil and they fail.</p>
		  	<p>When you have a boss that is always trying to find faults in you, not because he wants you to be better, but because he wants you fired. When you have a superior, who tries to suppress you in every way, not because he wants you to learn, but because he sees you as a competition. How do you overcome such evil attitudes?</p>
		  	<p>The word of God rightly states that we should overcome evil with good. Verily, our response to hatred should be love; our response to wickedness should be kindness. The more evil deeds are channeled towards you, the more good deeds you should return.</p>
		  	<p>You will never know how to overcome evil, until you learn to love against all odds.</p>
		  	<p>Joseph had brothers who really hated him; brothers, whose advice to him were not based on genuine love, but jealousy; brothers, who joined hands together to fight against his dreams and aspirations; brothers, who worked together to plan evil against him.</p>
		  	<p>Studying through the story of Joseph, I thought, “Did Joseph ever reciprocate the evil of his brothers?” No! The more they harbored evil plans against him, the more he had good intentions towards them. Even when they had declared themselves enemies to him, he still regarded them as brothers; and they were always the first people he shared his dreams with.</p>
		  	<p>Through his continuous love for them, despite their evil schemes, he was able to win them over. Indeed, evil can never be overcome with evil, but good.</p>
		  	<p>Jesus admonished us to love our enemies, because He knew that the only way we can win our enemies over, is through love.</p>
		  	<p>When people have hated you, and planned all evil schemes against you, yet receive love in return always, they will surely give up on hatred and learn to believe in love.</p>
		  	<p>Beloved, when people have failed you severally, and even your confidants have betrayed you, don’t try to get back at them; you can never overcome their evil by being evil. Continue in good deeds of love; good always prevails over evil. Be blessed!</p>
