		  	<p><i>For the word of God is quick, and powerful, and sharper than any twoedged sword, piercing even to the dividing asunder of soul and spirit, and of the joints and marrow, and is a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart. (Hebrews 4:12)</i></p>
		  	

		  	<blockquote>His Word is effective enough to bring into existence, that which never existed;</blockquote>

		  	<p>This scripture goes a long way to elaborate the effectiveness of God’s Word. Not only is the Word of God powerful, it is also a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart.</p>
		  	<p>Any word spoken by God is quick, powerful, active, living, productive, eternal, supreme and transformative. Let’s quickly prove the effectiveness of God’s Word, using excerpts from the scriptures:</p>
		  	<p>God’s Word does not return to Him void — it has a purpose! As the rain and dew gives bread to the sower, so is His Word — it is productive! Heaven and earth might pass away, but His Word will still remain — it is eternal! His Word has He exalted above all of His names — it is Supreme!</p>
		  	<p>If His Word has a purpose, it will surely be fulfilled; if His Word is productive, we shall never lack; if His Word is eternal, it endures forever; if His Word is Supreme, it is above every other thing! Not even the system of the world, its rules and principles can contest the Power of God’s Word.</p>
		  	<p>Psalm 107:20 says that He sent His Word, and healed their diseases. It is obvious the Word of God is healing. It is sharper than any sword; more accurate than the surgical blade.</p>
		  	<p>There are some ailments that require a surgical operation; what the surgeons use is the surgical blade. If a mere surgical blade can be used to perform an operation, which restores the health of a man; how much more the Word of God?</p>
		  	<p>The Word of God is the sharpest; it cuts in precision the exact areas, pierces through every infirmity, and results in Divine Health. What the surgical blade cannot do, the Word of God can perform.</p>
		  	<p>Furthermore, a surgeon can never give you a hundred percent guarantee of carrying out a successful operation, no matter the level of his expertise. On the contrary, the Word of God has never and will never fail; in it, we have a great assurance — it is reliable!</p>
		  	<p>How was the world created? The Word! God did not begin to dig up the seas, mould the animals or construct the structure of the earth; all He did was to speak, and it was so. That’s how effective God’s Word is!</p>
		  	<p>When the earth was dark, He spoke light; when it was formless, He spoke shape. Likewise beloved, we must learn to speak the Word of God, not minding what the situation looks like.</p>
		  	<p>His Word is effective enough to bring into existence, that which never existed; in the same way, His Word is effective enough to take out of existence, that which already exists. Cancer might exist in your body, but His Word is effective enough to uproot it. More than you rely on anything else, trust in His Word. Be blessed!</p>
