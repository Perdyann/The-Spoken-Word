		  	<p><i>And the angel of the Lord appeared unto him in a flame of fire out of the midst of a bush: and he looked, and, behold, the bush burned with fire, and the bush was not consumed. (Exodus 3:2)</i></p>


		  	<blockquote>The Prison experience is what ushers a man into the Palace; there is never a palace without a prison. Trial is only but a gateway to glory! </blockquote>

		  	<p>The bush was burned, but never consumed. As I envisaged an image of this in my mind, I began to wonder — what was the purpose of God showing Moses a burning bush, which remained unconsumed? — No longer had I pondered upon this thought than I received deeper insight to it.</p>
		  	<p>Verily, God might not stop a bush from being burned, but will supernaturally prevent it from being consumed. He did not stop Shedrach, Meshach and Abednego from being thrown into the fire, but He prevented them from being consumed. He did not stop Daniel from being thrown into the lion’s den, but he prevented him from being consumed.</p>
		  	<p>Likewise, God might not stop us from being tried, but He makes available grace for us to overcome, and not be consumed. It doesn’t matter what you are going through today, just have it in mind, that you are inconsumable.</p>
		  	<p>Heating up the fiery furnace seven times, was not enough to consume a strand of their hair [Shedrach, Meshach and Abednego]. Beloved, it is evident that even in the height of trials, we remain inconsumable. It is written:</p>
		  	<p><i>For I am the Lord, I change not; therefore ye sons of Jacob are not consumed. (Malachi 3:6)</i></p>
		  	<p>As long as the Lord remains unchangeable, we are inconsumable. Indeed, everything on earth is bound to pass away, even the earth itself; but only the Word of God is constant. God is unchangeable! Therefore, it is certain that we are inconsumable!</p>
		  	<p>We can only be consumed when God changes; verily, He can never change. No matter the magnitude of trials posed before you, remain confident in this truth, that as long as the Lord lives, you are inconsumable. Never be afraid of defeat, disappointment, discouragement or failure. We are above all that, because the Lord changeth not.</p>
		  	<p>Trials are not to break you, but to make you. We can draw a conclusion from the case of Joseph—The Prison experience is what ushers a man into the Palace; there is never a palace without a prison—Trial is only but a gateway to glory!</p>
		  	<p>Beloved, amidst the turbulence of burdensome and diverse trials you might be facing, be consoled in the truth that you remain inconsumable, as long as the Lord lives. Be blessed!</p>
