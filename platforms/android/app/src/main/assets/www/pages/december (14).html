		  	<p><i>I will praise thee; for I am fearfully and wonderfully made: marvellous are thy works; and that my soul knoweth right well. (Psalms 139:14)</i></p>
		 

		  	<blockquote>People respect the origin of ideas much more than the result of ideas. They are more concerned about whose idea it is than what changes the idea must have made.</blockquote>

		  	<p>Some years ago, I walked into the carphone warehouse with an intention of getting a new gadget. I was not just looking for any brand, but I had specific brands, which I desired.</p>
		  	<p>It is funny to know that some other phones can do what the Apple iPhone can do, but for some reason, people are in a hurry to get the latest version of it. This is simply because they trust the quality and reputation of Apple gadgets.</p>
		  	<p>Verily, the reason why some products are valued is not actually because of their real worth, but because of the maker. The reason why some books are more purchased and read is not because of how well they were written, but the Author. The reason why some songs are more commonly sung is not because of how well they sound but the Artiste, who composed it.</p>
		  	<p>Likewise beloved, your value is not measured by your efforts, but your brand and make. When people speak about gadgets and cars, you hear them ask, “What brand is it? What make is it?”</p>
		  	<p>People respect the origin of ideas much more than the result of ideas. They are sometimes more concerned about whose idea it is than what changes the idea must have made. You are God’s idea!</p>
		  	<p>The scripture today proves that we are fearfully and wonderfully made by God. We are God’s make and God’s brand. Do you think God will make something that is not marvelous?</p>
		  	<p>If people will value Apple product because of its brand, how much more value have you, as being God’s brand? If people can trust the quality of Apple products, how much more can you trust the quality of what God has made?</p>
		  	<p>Beloved, you are highly valued, not because of your efforts, but because He made you. Don’t let anyone devalue or under-price you, because you are God’s best, God’s brand, God’s make and God’s idea!</p>
		  	<p>God’s works can only be marvelous! He wouldn’t create poverty stricken, ill-fated and useless people. The fact that you are created by God is enough evidence that you are marvelous and great. Don’t let anyone tell you anything contrary to this truth.</p>
		  	<p>You are who you are not by your efforts, strength or ability, but by the splendor of He, who made you.</p>
		  	<p>Everything God made is great by virtue of the maker. However, there is something unique about you. God created the light first, firmament, animals... and finally man.</p>
		  	<p>Do you know that Apple did not release their best first? They reserved it for the last. The iPhone 5 as at this moment is more valued than all other gadgets of this brand simply because it is the latest version.</p>
		  	<p>Celebrate beloved, you are the latest version of God’s brand. More valuable than anything else; you are God’s best. Be blessed!</p>
