		  	<p><i>Nevertheless among the chief rulers also many believed on him; but because of the Pharisees they did not confess him, lest they should be put out of the synagogue:</i></p>
		  	<p><i>For they loved the praise of men more than the praise of God. (John 2:42-43)</i></p>


		  	<blockquote>The world is not our final resting place. The men, who walked on the earth centuries ago, are nothing but foot-prints now. </blockquote>

		  	<p>The bible highlights two steps to Salvation; believing in the heart and confessing with the mouth. (Romans 10:9-10). Secretly believing in your heart, without confessing, is not salvation yet.</p>
		  	<p>This passage gives us an understanding that some chief rulers actually believed in God, but were so in love with the world, that they refused to confess it. For they loved the praise of men more than the praise of God.</p>
		  	<p>Indeed, many people actually prefer praises from men to the praise of God. Even in this era, there are still some, who have heard God’s Word, believed it, perhaps confessed secretly, but do not want to let their peers know what they stand for. Many are ashamed of God before the public. It is written,</p>
		  	<p><i>Whosoever therefore shall be ashamed of me and of my words in this adulterous and sinful generation; of him also shall the Son of man be ashamed, when he cometh in the glory of his Father with the holy angels. (Mark 8:38)</i></p>
		  	<p>At some certain seasons of trials and crises, many have denied being Christians.</p>
		  	<p>How confident are you to do the work of God? How proud are you to be saved? Would you rather please the crowd than God? Would you rather do what the world tells you to do, or will you cling to the Fathers will? When God commands you to do something, do you let people talk you out of it?</p>
		  	<p>Of what use is it that the world will praise you, embrace you, glorify and approve you, but in the eyes of God, you are not worthy.</p>
		  	<p><i>If the world hate you, ye know that it hated me before it hated you.</i></p>
		  	<p><i>If ye were of the world, the world would love his own: but because ye are not of the world, but I have chosen you out of the world, therefore the world hateth you. (John 15:18-19)</i></p>
		  	<p>When you make up your mind to walk in the ways of God, the world will hate you, your friends will walk away, your family might persecute you; but that’s just a sign that you’re living above them. Also, bear in mind that Jesus was hated before you.</p>
		  	<p>There are some decisions I might choose to make, in which everyone will be proud of me, but that is not what I consider. Will God be pleased?</p>
		  	<p>Until you learn to align your decisions and plans to God’s will, you are still of the world.</p>
		  	<p>The world is not our final resting place. The men, who walked on the earth centuries ago, are nothing but foot-prints now. Seeing then that no one will abide here forever, why then should we cling more firmly to the glory that comes from man, than that which God gives?</p>
		  	<p>When God puts a Word in your mouth, preach it! Don’t be bothered about who will embrace it or not. You can never please everyone at the same time; just be focused on pleasing God.</p>
		  	<p>More than you love to be approved, respected and praised by men; choose to be approved and blameless before God. Be blessed!</p>
