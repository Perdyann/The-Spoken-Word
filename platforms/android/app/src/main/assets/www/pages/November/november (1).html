		  	<p><i>And the earth was without form, and void; and darkness was upon the face of the deep. And the Spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters.</i></p>
		  	<p><i>And God said, Let there be light: and there was light. (Genesis 1:2-3)</i></p>
		  	

		  	<blockquote>To get the best out of life, make the best out of your confessions.</blockquote>

		  	<p>When God looked at the earth, what He saw was darkness; however, He chose not to speak what He saw, but what He desired. Rather than speaking darkness, as the reality seemed, He spoke the light into manifestation.</p>
		  	<p>I’ve approached a lot of people with the idea of speaking positively; I must admit, not everyone bought this idea.</p>
		  	<p>So often I have said, “You don’t need to make negative confessions because the situation seems rough; don’t make your confessions based on situations, but on God’s Word ...” However, many opposed saying, “C’mon Zuriel, let’s call a spade a spade; be realistic!”</p>
		  	<p>What they fail to realize is that as long as a spade is called a spade, it remains a spade, but when it is called something better, it becomes better. In essence, the spade is not really what it looks like, but what you call it.</p>
		  	<p>To think of it, if God was to speak to the earth based on what it looked like, He would have capitalized on its darkness and formlessness. Rather, seeing that the earth was dark, He spoke light. Sons of God don’t say things as they are; they call into existence, things that are not.</p>
		  	<p>As long as you keep saying things as they are, they will always remain what they’ve always been; to get the best out of life, make the best out of your confessions. A spade ceases to be a spade when it is called something different; darkness ceases to be dark when it is called light.</p>
		  	<p>Don’t be so kin on being realistic as ignorant people will say; if God wanted to be realistic, do you think He would have called light in a dark situation? However, when He spoke, the situation changed to what He said. Don’t align your confessions to the present situation; instead, let the situation conform to your confessions.</p>
		  	<p>Verily, your confession must change before any situation can change. A man, who makes confessions based on his present situation, lives a stagnant life. A forward life is characterized by an increase in confession.</p>
		  	<p>It was not until God spoke, that the earth became what He wanted it to be. Until you speak, things will never be as you desire. In all, our confessions should not be propelled by sight, but by faith.</p>
		  	<p>Don’t look at the ill circumstances before you start to make powerful confessions; you don’t need sight to act faith. Even when darkness is obvious, speak light.</p>
		  	<p>Don’t join the crew of ignorant fellows that insist on saying things as they are (being realistic, as they claim); by faith, spiritual men call things, which be not as though they were. (Romans 4:17)</p>
		  	<p>The earth wouldn’t be what it is today, if God had not spoken contrary to what He saw. Don’t say what you see physically, say something higher.</p>
		  	<p>Where there is death, speak life! Where there is formlessness, speak shape; where there is darkness, speak light! Operate by faith, and not by sight. Be blessed!</p>
