		  	<p><i>If a man preaches, let him do it with God speaking through him. If a man helps others, let him do it with the strength God gives. So in all things God may be honored through Jesus Christ. Shining-greatness and power belong to Him forever. Let it be so. (1 Peter 4:11 NLV)</i></p>

		  	<blockquote>Until you grasp the understanding that you are not the one in action, but God, your results will always be limited. </blockquote>

		  	<p>If there’s one confession I can never cease to make, it is, “The Holy Spirit functions in me.” Beloved, this is solely the mindset, which I received, that turned my life all around for good.</p>
		  	<p>By having a mindset that the Holy Spirit is resident and functions in you, you will understand that when you are speaking, it is God speaking through you (Your words can never fail); when you are involved in something, God is involved in it (It is a success); When you lay hands on the sick, it is God touching them (healing is certain); When you write an exam, God has just written through you (You’d only produce God’s result — the best).</p>
		  	<p>Until you grasp the understanding that you are not the one in action, but God, your results will always be limited.</p>
		  	<p>There is nothing as powerful as having the Holy Spirit function in you. You cannot be sick! Light and darkness have no union whatsoever; thus, the Holy Spirit cannot share boundaries with sickness.</p>
		  	<p>Beloved there is nothing we cannot do when the Holy Spirit functions in us. Little wonder it is written: <i> I can do all things through Christ which strengtheneth me. (Philippians 4:13). </i></p>
		  	<p>Have this mindset always—the Holy Spirit functions in us; there is nothing that is impossible for us; we only produce God’s result! — But most importantly we should always attribute all glory to God.</p>
		  	<p>Let God be honored in your success! When you have operated with this mindset, and all doors have swung open unto you, do not call it a mere coincidence. As it is written, <i> ‘So in all things God may be honored through Jesus Christ. Shining-greatness and power belong to Him forever. Let it be so.’ </i> Testify to the glory of God.</p>
		  	<p>He functions in us, we can do all things through Christ; He will never share his glory with anyone (Isaiah 42:8). Be blessed!</p>
