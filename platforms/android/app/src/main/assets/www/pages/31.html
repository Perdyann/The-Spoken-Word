		  	<p><i>And Jesus said unto him, No man, having put his hand to the plough, and looking back, is fit for the kingdom of God. (Luke 9:62)</i></p>


		  	<blockquote>The brightness of your future is capable of overshadowing the dimness of your past. Stop looking back!</blockquote>

		  	<p>Jesus called some men to follow Him; one wanted to bury his father first, the other wanted to bid farewell to his family first. Beloved, you don’t need to go back, before you can move forward... that will only hold you at the same spot for too long.</p>
		  	<p>The reason why many people have suffered stagnancy for too long is because they are still living in their past. Quite a lot of people fail to realize that they cannot start the next chapter of their lives if they keep re-visiting previous chapters.</p>
		  	<p>No man, who starts to plow a field and looks back, is ready for the kingdom of God. Either choose your past or the future, trying to live in both concurrently will only yield stagnancy.</p>
		  	<p>However, one assurance I confidently give is your latter is greater than your past.</p>
		  	<p>Many years ago, I used to wish that I could turn back the hands of time; there are some things, which I felt that I didn’t do right. I wanted to go back and amend my wrongs, but in no time I realized that the brightness of my future is capable of overshadowing the dimness of my past.</p>
		  	<p>This particular realization filled me with so much enthusiasm and passion to make the best out of my future. Since that day, I never looked back again. Stop re-visiting closed chapters; stop re-opening healed wounds.</p>
		  	<p>What purpose exists on earth other than the work of God? Were you created for mere reproduction? That’s too small a reason to live! Were you created to just prosper financially? That wouldn’t be worth it, no man leaves this world with a penny.</p>
		  	<p>There is more to your life than what you see - purpose! Our utmost concern should be to fulfill our divine purpose. I don’t think the man, who wanted to bid his family farewell had an understanding of purpose; neither do I think that the man, who wanted to bury his father had that understanding.</p>
		  	<p>Those who look back are not fit for the journey; have you made up your mind to follow Jesus, or are you still living in stagnancy?</p>
		  	<p>It’s time to do away with the pains of the past, the mindset of old and the friends of yesterday. Your best days are not behind you, they are in-front of you.</p>
		  	<p>I’ve heard so many say, “I used to be rich, intelligent, great, and so on.” What these fellows fail to realize is that they are unconsciously and unknowingly living in their past. They cherish the past-glory so much that they are blinded to envisage the greatness ahead.</p>
		  	<p>What makes you think that your best days are behind you? That’s a tricky lie from the devil to keep you stagnant. Your best days are ahead, stop looking back. Be blessed!</p>
