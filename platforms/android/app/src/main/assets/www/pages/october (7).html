		  	<p><i>So trust in the Lord (commit yourself to Him, lean on Him, hope confidently in Him) forever; for the Lord God is an everlasting Rock [the Rock of Ages]. (Isaiah 26:4)</i></p>

		  	<blockquote>The comfort, which pillows cannot give; and the victory which sophisticated weapons cannot give, are freely given by the Rock</blockquote>

		  	<p>There is something I observed about rocks in the scriptures; our study today will highlight the impact of the Rock of Ages. There are a few instances when a rock or stone brought about blessings and victories.</p>
		  	<p>In Genesis 28, when Jacob tarried in a city at night, and sought to lay there because the sun was set, there was no comfortable pillow that he could lay his head on, but a stone.</p>
		  	<p>Jacob thought that he was lying on a mere stone, but did not realize until later, that he set his head upon the Rock. If he had lain on a mere stone, it would have probably resulted in neck pain, but when he laid on the rock, it resulted in a blessed vision.</p>
		  	<p>Something great happens when we set our head upon the rock; you might not have any pillow to rest with, but there is always a Rock to lean on.</p>
		  	<p>Furthermore, David knew that he was going to battle against a mighty and feared giant, yet he refuse to take any sophisticated weapon, helmet, breastplate or even a sword. All he used to defeat the giant was a stone. It is easy to think that it was a mere stone, but no! It was the Rock.</p>
		  	<p>Isnâ€™t it amazing to comprehend that the comfort, which pillows could not give; and the victory which sophisticated weapons could not give, are freely given by the Rock? Go to the Rock!</p>
		  	<p>The scripture today admonishes us to commit ourselves to, lean on, and hope in the Rock. God is our Rock! In Him, we have shelter, raiment, provision, protection and hope in the most hopeless situation.</p>
		  	<p>It is interesting to fathom that God is not just referred to as the Rock, but the Rock of Ages. In essence, He is our everlasting Rock.</p>
		  	<p>The blessings of Jacob, when he set his head on the Rock, must have been received centuries ago; the victory of David, when he flung the Rock against Goliath, was gained centuries ago. Hence, it is easy to embrace the thought that situations might have changed now, and the Rock no longer exists. No!</p>
		  	<p>The scripture portrays that He is an everlasting Rock of ages; in essence, He was the Rock of victories and blessings centuries ago, He is the Rock today, and will remain the Rock as long as eternity counts.</p>
		  	<p>Seeing then that we have shelter, raiment, food, comfort, victory and blessings in the Rock of all Ages, why then should we worry? Let us therefore lean and hope confidently in God, for it is He that grants the comfort and victory that many pillows and weapons cannot give.</p>
		  	<p>He will grant us that, which our ability and efforts can never give; lean on Him. Be blessed!</p>
