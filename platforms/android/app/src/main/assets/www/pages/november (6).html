		  <div class="panel-body" style="text-align:justify">


		  	<p><i>For though we walk (live) in the flesh, we are not carrying on our warfare according to the flesh and using mere human weapons.</i></p>
		  	<p><i>For the weapons of our warfare are not physical [weapons of flesh and blood], but they are mighty before God for the overthrow and destruction of strongholds, (2 Corinthians 10:3-4 AMP)</i></p>

		  	<blockquote>Life is Spiritual; there are barely few things that happen in the physical realm, which has not been spiritually manipulated.</blockquote>

		  	<p>Spiritual battles can never be fought with physical weapons; as the scripture rightly states, the weapons of our warfare are mighty to the pulling down of strongholds.</p>
		  	<p>The reason why a lot of people have not been able to pull down every strong hold in their lives, ministry and family is probably because they have attempted to do this through carnal means. Carnal weapons cannot be used for spiritual battles.</p>
		  	<p>David understood that his battle with Goliath was more spiritual than physical; he did not see it as a mere battle between two men, but as one between God and an uncircumcised philistine.</p>
		  	<p>This proved that it was not just a carnal battle, but a spiritual one. Thus, David insisted on going to the battle field with no physical weapon or ammunition, but spiritual equipments. He went in the name of the Lord, and in faith.</p>
		  	<p>Goliath, who was considered a stronghold by everyone, was overthrown and destroyed. The weapons of our warfare are indeed not physical. Stop attempting to resolve spiritual issues through physical means; that will only result in wasted effort.</p>
		  	<p>It is written,</p>
		  	<p><i>For we wrestle not against flesh and blood, but against principalities, against powers, against the rulers of the darkness of this world, against spiritual wickedness in high places.</i></p>
		  	<p><i>Wherefore take unto you the whole armour of God, that ye may be able to withstand in the evil day, and having done all, to stand. (Ephesians 6:12-13)</i></p>
		  	<p>If we were engaged in a physical wrestling, the most appropriate weapons to use would have been physical ones; but it is clearly spelt out here, that our battle is against wickedness in high places.</p>
		  	<p>Life is Spiritual; there are barely few things that happen in the physical realm, which has not been spiritually manipulated. Some of the things we refer to as mere coincidence are not ordinary; they were orchestrated from the spiritual realm.</p>
		  	<p>Need I say more? Stop getting physically equipped, when you are spiritually empty. Put on the whole armour of God! Subsequently, we will study in details the spiritual equipment every born-again man must have. Be blessed!</p>
