		  	<blockquote>Your identity and greatness are hidden in the thoughts of your heart. When you realize that you’ve been in any situation for too long, then it’s time to think of something new. </blockquote>

		  	<p>Have you ever wondered what fetched the woman with the issue of blood her healing?</p>
		  	<p>Have you ever wondered what fetched the paralyzed man in Capernaum his health?</p>
		  	<p>Have you ever wondered what restored the prodigal son to his place of sonship?</p>
		  	<p>It was a thought; it is the saving mindset... Indeed, just an idea that came whispering to them... Verily, their breakthroughs emanated from a mere thought.</p>
		  	<p>The woman with the issue of blood thought to herself saying, “if only I could touch the hem of His garment, I will be healed.” (Mark 5:28). Likewise, the prodigal son thought to himself and reached a conclusion saying, “I will arise and go to my father, and say Father take me as your higher servant”, (Luke 15:18-19) and again, despite the pushing crowd, the friends of the paralyzed man thought to themselves saying, “if we could just dig the roof, perhaps we could lay down our paralyzed friend to the place where the Master (Jesus) is. (Mark 2:4).</p>
		  	<p>Having carefully considered all these, I am no longer surprised when the bible says, “As a man thinketh in his heart, so is he” (Proverbs 23:7)</p>
		  	<p>Your identity, your greatness, and your star are hidden in the thoughts of your heart. When you realize that you’ve been in any situation for too long, then it’s time to think of something new.</p>
		  	<p>Facebook is one social media that is largely patronized across the globe, ranging from Businesses, Academic institutions, Politics, News, Ministry and Individual bodies.</p>
		  	<p>It is amazing to fathom that such greatness was hidden in a mere thought of a young undergraduate student—Mark Zuckerberg. He must have just thought to himself, saying, “Why don’t I create a means of networking in this campus”, it may have been something meant for just his colleagues, but it grew above that, to the whole world. That’s what happens when an idea is incubated upon, and explored! Think</p>
		  	<p>Today, deliberately decide to think of a new strategy... consciously spend a bit of time in new ideas, then step out of your comfort zone to do something that you’ve never done before. Therein lies the revolution, transformation and anticipated breakthrough. Be blessed!</p>
