		  	<p><i>Now the Lord had said unto Abram, Get thee out of thy country, and from thy kindred, and from thy father’s house, unto a land that I will shew thee:</i></p>
		  	<p><i>And I will make of thee a great nation, and I will bless thee, and make thy name great; and thou shalt be a blessing: (Genesis 12:1-2)</i></p>

		  	<blockquote>No nation has prospects great enough to make any man great. Greatness is hidden in a man, and not the nation. </blockquote>

		  	<p>God had beautiful plans to bless Abraham, that he might be a blessing, to make his name great, and to make a great nation out of him. But before He could execute these plans in the life of Abraham, He commanded him to leave his country to another land.</p>
		  	<p>It is not until God had commanded him to leave his nation, that the blessings could then be pronounced.</p>
		  	<p>Abraham was born in a certain country, but his purpose awaited him in another land. For a second, I wondered, why wasn’t he born in the land of his purpose? Why was migration necessary? This particularly gives me an understanding:</p>
		  	<p>The fact that you are born in a certain land does not restrict you to the boundaries of that land.</p>
		  	<p>So often the attitude of citizens to immigrants might be quite unwelcoming, some people are of the opinion that everyone should remain in their country of birth. What they fail to realize is that it is God who chooses where a man’s feet is planted. It is written:</p>
		  	<p><i>The earth is the Lord’s, and the fulness thereof; the world, and they that dwell therein. (Psalms 24:1)</i></p>
		  	<p>It is God who created the earth and the nations in it. He it is, who decides where anyone should be; the constitution is not enough limitation when purpose is involved.</p>
		  	<p>Being born in a land does not guarantee that your entire assignments in life will be confined within its boundaries. Some assignments come with a requirement for you to leave a land for another.</p>
		  	<p>Joseph did not fulfill his entire purpose under his father’s roof; Moses did not accomplish his entire purpose under Pharaohs roof; Abraham had to migrate from his country to a different nation for purpose; The Apostles travelled through various cities, to spread the Word of God. This is just to name a few.</p>
		  	<p>Do you think the immigration rules were capable of keeping these fellows in their nations of birth, even when God’s purpose was calling them elsewhere?</p>
		  	<p>However, purposes vary, and not everyone might be required to leave his country for purpose.</p>
		  	<p>Nation, when translated means ethnicity; it does not necessarily involve migrating to a different country, but perhaps city as the case may be. In all things, ensure you are led by the Spirit of God. Abraham did not just decide to leave his country of his own accord; God told him to.</p>
		  	<p>Do not force yourself into a place that God has not led you to; do not go to any country or city with the sole purpose of searching for greener pastures . . . no! Wealth, opportunities and fortune are not in a city, but in the man.</p>
		  	<p>This message is not aimed at increasing the rate of migration; but understanding God’s direction. Sometimes we limit Divine purposes to our immediate environment, when God wants us to go beyond national boundaries.</p>
		  	<p>We need to understand God’s direction at every season; when Lot was to separate from Abraham, he did not seek God’s direction, rather, he chose the land that seemed to have great prospects; that was where he missed out.</p>
		  	<p>No nation has prospects great enough to make any man great. Greatness is hidden in a man, and not the nation.</p>
		  	<p>Just like a tree needs to be planted in the right environment to grow, you need to be in the right place to function. Stop making arrangements to move if God has not directed your steps. Be blessed!</p>
