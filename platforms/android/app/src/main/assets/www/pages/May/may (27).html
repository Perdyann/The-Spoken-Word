		  <div class="panel-body" style="text-align:justify">


		  	<p><i>For the gifts and calling of God are without repentance.(Romans 11:29)</i></p>


		  	<blockquote>We can only delay the fulfillment of God’s call, but never revoke or change it. </blockquote>

		  	<p>So often, we give people opportunities, assignments or even gifts, as the case may be, and when we realize that it’s not well appreciated or utilized, we might request it back.</p>
		  	<p>God is in every way unlike man. His gifts and callings are irrevocable, no matter how it is regarded. No matter how disobedient, unfaithful and unwilling we are to align to God’s call, He does not withdraw the Divine call.</p>
		  	<p>For the life of every man, there is a spoken Word of God. However, some people are aimed at acting contrary to that call in every way, but God does not withdraw His calling and gifts. Your purpose remains yours, whether you choose to fulfil it or not.</p>
		  	<p>When God sent Jonah to Nineveh, and he fled to Tarshish, I expected God to disqualify him for the assignment, kill him, or perhaps send someone better, who will regard the call highly.</p>
		  	<p><i>And the word of the Lord came unto Jonah the second time, saying,</i></p>
		  	<p><i>Arise, go unto Nineveh, that great city, and preach unto it the preaching that I bid thee.</i></p>
		  	<p><i>So Jonah arose, and went unto Nineveh, according to the word of the Lord. (Jonah 3:1-3)</i></p>
		  	<p>However, God aligned him back to the right course, despite the fact that he intentionally derailed. God did not withdraw the call, but disciplined Jonah, and placed him back in the right track.</p>
		  	<p>We really understand that God has great plans for our lives, but sometimes, we may feel that our mistakes or misbehavior has thwarted and aborted God’s ideal plan for us. Verily, God’s plan, purpose, assignment, gifts and call for your life cannot be revoked.</p>
		  	<p>The promises of men can be revoked, men will always judge you by who you are now; but God’s promise is irrevocable, He looks beyond your present mess, and sees your potentials and future.</p>
		  	<p>Beloved, it is obvious that even in our mistakes, and misbehaviors, God still tolerates us, and preserve His call on our lives. We can only delay the fulfillment of God’s call, but never revoke or change it.</p>
		  	<p>When God spoke to Jonah a second time, and sent him back to Nineveh, he obeyed. He should have done that earlier. He should have responded to the Divine call prior to that time. However, although he tarried in disobedience, God eventually led him back to track.</p>
		  	<p>It had its own consequences. If Jonah had obeyed initially, Nineveh would have been history (a finished chapter), but Jonah was just arriving. Likewise, your continuous refusal to respond to the Divine call is what results in delays.</p>
		  	<p>God had done so many great miracles for the Israelites; He had afflicted the Egyptians, He had caused the red sea to make a way, He had caused manna to rain down on them, He had done too much to mention, yet, they continually doubted Him.</p>
		  	<p>If God were a man, He might have withdrawn His promise from them; He might as well hold back His plans for them. But despite the unruly behaviors of the Israelites, God preserved their promise. However, the Promise land was supposed to be reached within days, but was rather reached within years. Their disobedience brought about delay, but not denial.</p>
		  	<p>A lot of people are just stepping into the realm which they should have reached years ago. Stop the delays! Build your confidence; it is very certain that God cannot withdraw the potentials He has deposited within us. You might be in a muss today, but God will make a message out of your mess. Be blessed!</p>
