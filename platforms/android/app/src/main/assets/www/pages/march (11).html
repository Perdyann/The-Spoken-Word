		  	<p><i>Remember all thy offerings, and accept thy burnt sacrifice; Selah. (Psalm 20:3)</i></p>

		  	<blockquote>Favor is what causes the records to be checked again, for your sake</blockquote>

		  	<p>As I meditated on this Word, something deeper was ushered into my mind. This indeed flooded my thoughts, and thoughts of it abode as my companion from thence.</p>
		  	<p>So often, we’ve stepped out of our comfort zones, to make sacrifices for the sake of other people. Years may come by, yet it seems, like those sacrifices are not being remembered or appreciated. This often happens because we rely on men to reward us. However, the Lord always rewards those that diligently seek Him. (Hebrews 11:6)</p>
		  	<p>The Lord gave me a particular scriptural instance of someone who was rewarded in due time. Mordecai!</p>
		  	<p><i>In those days, while Mordecai sat in the king’s gate, two of the king’s chamberlains, Bigthan and Teresh, of those which kept the door, were wroth, and sought to lay hands on the king Ahasuerus.</i></p>
		  	<p><i>And the thing was known to Mordecai, who told it unto Esther the queen; and Esther certified the king thereof in Mordecai’s name.</i></p>
		  	<p><i>And when inquisition was made of the matter, it was found out; therefore they were both hanged on a tree: and it was written in the book of the chronicles before the king. (Esther 2:21-23)</i></p>
		  	<p>Mordecai spilled the secret sinister plan, which the guards harbored against the king. The king might not have lived so long, had it not been for Mordecai, who decided not to remain silent, at the expense of his king.</p>
		  	<p>Indeed, this act was recorded in the book, but years went by without it being mentioned again. At this juncture, it may have seemed as though Mordecai was never going to be rewarded by the king anymore. He wasn’t anxious for a reward, for he didn’t depend on the reward of man.</p>
		  	<p>However, just when the due time of his reward approached, it happened this way </p>
		  	<p><i>On that night could not the king sleep, and he commanded to bring the book of records of the chronicles; and they were read before the king.</i></p>
		  	<p><i>And it was found written, that Mordecai had told of Bigthana and Teresh, two of the king’s chamberlains, the keepers of the door, who sought to lay hand on the king Ahasuerus.</i></p>
		  	<p><i>And the king said, What honour and dignity hath been done to Mordecai for this? Then said the king’s servants that ministered unto him, There is nothing done for him. (Esther 6:1-3)</i></p>
		  	<p>Verily, for his sake, the King was made restless that night! It was not until he favored Mordecai that he found rest.</p>
		  	<p>Beloved, when your appointed time of favor comes, rest will be deprived of everyone involved, until you are granted favor. Indeed, protocols will be broken for your sake.</p>
		  	<p>All the while Mordecai had done well to the Kingdom, it was not remembered, but favor is what causes the records to be checked again, for your sake. Favor will single you out!</p>
		  	<p>There will surely be a reward for your sacrifice; just be still! Though it tarries, the reward will surely come in the appointed season.</p>
		  	<p>If Mordecai had been rewarded as soon as he had saved the king, he might have been blessed and forgotten, thus, when such a perilous time approaches, he may not stand the plot of Haman. In exchange for the evil Haman plotted for Mordecai, he was rewarded by the King for his good deeds.</p>
		  	<p>It pays to have your reward in the right time. Don’t rush God! God is just. He is not blind to the sacrifice of love, which you have made to your neighbors’. He is not blind to observe the sleepless nights you had, in intercession for your nation. Just in time, your sacrifice will be remembered with a reward. Be blessed!</p>
