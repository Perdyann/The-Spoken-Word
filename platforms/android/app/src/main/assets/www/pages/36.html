		  	<h5><strong>FAITH: Defies the Course of Nature and Human Reasoning.</strong></h5>

		  	<p><i>And the sun stood still, and the moon stayed, until the people had avenged themselves upon their enemies. Is not this written in the book of Jasher? So the sun stood still in the midst of heaven, and hasted not to go down about a whole day. (Joshua 10:13)</i></p>
		  	


		  	<blockquote>I am convinced that no matter how rigid the laws of nature may seem, it can still be altered when Faith comes to play</blockquote>

		  	<p>Naturally, the Sun shines by day, and the moon governs the night. These two operate according to time; but the system was altered in the time of Joshua... Naturally, once a man dies, he cannot live again; Lazarus and many others did... Naturally, when a lady reaches menopause, she cannot conceive again; Sarah did... Naturally, a sea cannot part into two walls; God did it, in the time of Moses, Elijah and Elisha... Naturally, a man cannot walk on water; Jesus did.</p>
		  	<p>I am convinced that no matter how rigid the laws of nature may seem, it can still be altered when Faith comes to play. As long as Peter had faith, he walked on the water with Jesus, but as soon as his faith was shaken, he began to sink. (Matthew 14:29-30) This fully portrays the truth that faith is what gives man an advantage over nature.</p>
		  	<p>Believe is natural and could be shaken by natural circumstances, but faith goes far beyond the natural. A man diagnosed with cancer may initially believe he would get better, but if his ailment worsens to a situation whereby the Doctor gives him a certain time period, beyond which he cannot live; he may start getting ready to die. Why? Circumstances may have risen and caused him to stop believing. At this point, only faith could fetch him his healing. Faith! It looks beyond the natural.</p>
		  	<p>It is very important to understand that faith not only defies the course of nature, but that of human reasoning as well. When God promised Abraham a child through Sarah, he intentionally refused to think of the possibilities of Sarah conceiving, considering the fact that she was 90 years old already. The bible says,</p>
		  	<p><i>... for in Isaac shall thy seed be called. (Genesis 21:12)</i></p>
		  	<p>Earlier, God had assured Abraham that it is through Isaac that He shall fulfil His promise. Yet, when Abraham was told to offer his son Isaac, he refused to think about why God will instruct him to terminate His own promise.</p>
		  	<p>In order to have a successful walk with God, you have to decide to shut up your brain! Donâ€™t think... Act faith! There is nothing that weakens the faith of man as much as reasoning, and thinking out possibilities. This is because; faith always pushes man to do the impossible, and unthinkable.</p>
		  	<p>Faith could do much more than nature can... Just activate your faith by choosing not to operate on the basis of human reasoning. Be blessed!</p>
