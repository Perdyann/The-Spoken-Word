		  <div class="panel-body" style="text-align:justify">


		  	<p><i>Be not deceived; God is not mocked: for whatsoever a man soweth, that shall he also reap.</i></p>
		  	<p><i>For he that soweth to his flesh shall of the flesh reap corruption; but he that soweth to the Spirit shall of the Spirit reap life everlasting. (Galatians 6:7-8)</i></p>

		  	<blockquote>We are sculptors of our lives; our life can only yield us the result of what we have sown. </blockquote>

		  	<p>I love the use of the term ‘whatsoever’ in this passage; It means anything! In essence, what we will reap in life is solely dependent on what we have sown. If you sow great seeds, you will reap greatness in immeasurable folds. Likewise, if you sow evil, calamity will be heaped up for you to receive.</p>
		  	<p>The scripture means that all things are possible! If you want to receive the impossible, sow the impossible . . . If you want to achieve uncommon and distinct success, start by sowing exceptionally.</p>
		  	<p>We have heard of great virtues in life; virtues of faith, love, mercy, kindness, hope, amongst others. Making a deliberate decision to sow these virtues daily will result in an excellent life.</p>
		  	<p>We know how great faith works; if you can sow an action of faith daily, you’re assured of reaping great results.</p>
		  	<p>We know how powerful God’s Word is; if you can deposit one Word of God into your Spirit daily, you’re assured of living a blissful life.</p>
		  	<p>We know how power-packed our words are; if you can confess great words day and night, you’re assured of living a Supernatural life.</p>
		  	<p>Beloved, we are sculptors of our lives; our life can only yield us the result of what we have sown. Why not make a decision today, to start making powerful deposits into your life, and the lives of those around you. It is written:</p>
		  	<p><i>He that soweth iniquity shall reap vanity: and the rod of his anger shall fail. (Proverbs 22:8)</i></p>
		  	<p>Where you are today, is as a result of what you sowed yesterday. Do you really think about your actions before taking them? Never sow iniquity and expect to reap bountifully. If you are tired of reaping vanity, then change the way you sow. Again it is written:</p>
		  	<p><i>They that sow in tears shall reap in joy. He that goeth forth and weepeth, bearing precious seed, shall doubtless come again with rejoicing, bringing his sheaves with him. (Psalms 126:5-6)</i></p>
		  	<p>It might not be easy to sow great seeds. It may involve extra labor, strength, time or resources, but verily, all these will in no way be comparable with your results.</p>
		  	<p>Those, who sowed precious seeds in tears, reaped sheaves in rejoicing. You cannot expect to reap something that you have not sown.</p>
		  	<p>There is so much we can do to transform the world and the lives of those therein. Whatever change you desire to see in your life, start by sowing towards it.</p>
		  	<p>In a world where hatred abounds, be the sower of love; in a world where there is so much lack, be the giver; in a world full of darkness, shine as the light. Be the change you want to see. Be blessed!</p>
