		  	<p><i>Thou wilt shew me the path of life: in thy presence is fulness of joy; at thy right hand there are pleasures for evermore. (Psalm 16:11)</i></p>
		  

		  	<blockquote>The best of a man’s effort equals nullity in the absence of God. </blockquote>

		  	<p>Fullness of joy and everlasting pleasures are not found anywhere, but in the presence of God. Ever experienced such joy that put your sorrows in the past? Ever felt such pleasure that not just endured for a temporal period, but outlived time?</p>
		  	<p>In the presence of God, we are transformed; in His presence, we are healed; in His presence, we are elated; in His presence, treasures are birthed; in His presence, questions are answered; in His presence, mysteries are revealed.</p>
		  	<p><i>And he said unto him, If thy presence go not with me, carry us not up hence. (Exodus 33:15)</i></p>
		  	<p>Nothing extra-ordinary can ever be achieved outside the presence of God. Little wonder Moses was unwilling to go anywhere if the presence of the Lord did not go with him. He knew that the height of his effort could not yield any success, in the absence of God. Likewise beloved, the best of a man’s effort equals nullity in the absence of God.</p>
		  	<p>People perceive the presence of God to be a Church building, temple or court. People perceive that presence to be a something that comes down from heaven, only during conferential gatherings. However, God’s presence transcends all of these.</p>
		  	<p>In the time of Moses, God’s presence was not accessible by everyone; thus, at appointed seasons, the Lord came like a cloud, and communed with Moses, after which, He departed.</p>
		  	<p>The presence of God in this era transcends the era of old; beloved, God is omnipresent, He sees everything that happens, and nothing is hidden from Him. However, the fact that He is present everywhere does not guarantee that we are in His presence every hour.</p>
		  	<p>We can be in the Church and not be in the presence of God; we can be present in conferential gatherings, fellowships and meetings, yet not be in God’s presence.</p>
		  	<p>The presence of God is a Spiritual realm that captures your mind, consciousness and thoughts. Thus, when you are absent minded, even in a conference where God is present, you remain outside His presence.</p>
		  	<p>Dwelling in the presence of God entails having your mind, thoughts and actions channeled towards God, and shaped by His Word. It is consciously spending quality time hearing from the Father and communing with Him.</p>
		  	<p>No matter how often you go to church, when your communication with God is poor, you are not in His presence.</p>
		  	<p>You can be driving and be in God’s presence; you can be at work and still dwell in His presence. Just let your mind and thoughts stay tuned to the Lord, and stir up your Spirit constantly, by the inspired Words of the Holy Ghost.</p>
		  	<p>Abide in His presence, where nothing remains impossible. Be blessed!</p>
