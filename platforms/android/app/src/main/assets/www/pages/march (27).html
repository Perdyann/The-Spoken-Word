		  	<p><i>Either make the tree good, and his fruit good; or else make the tree corrupt, and his fruit corrupt: for the tree is known by his fruit. (Matthew 12:33)</i></p>

		  	<blockquote>Whatsoever a man gets soaked up with, that will he release when he is squeezed. </blockquote>

		  	<p>There is nothing that reveals a man as much as that which proceeds out of him. Our fruits could be our legacies, lifestyle, or even our words. These are the things that tell who we really are.</p>
		  	<p>As I sat under the counsel of my Pastor some years back, I complained of my inability to serve God the way I really desired. I complained of my inability to live the lifestyle which I genuinely hoped to live. In just a sentence, he birthed a new mindset in me. He said, “Just like a sponge soaked up with vinegar releases vinegar, and a sponge, soaked up with water releases water; whatsoever a man gets soaked up with, that will he release when he is squeezed.”</p>
		  	<p>Indeed, when we invest in our lives, rich and transforming information and words of wisdom inspired by the Word of God, we get so rich and equipped, such that when we are squeezed by any form of trials, all we reveal is divinity.</p>
		  	<p>When a carnal man is pressed by a slight trial, he is instantly crushed. Whereas, when a man of the Spirit is pressed on all sides, by trials and persecution, all that flows out of him is the power to overcome.</p>
		  	<p>What comes out of you? Power or defeat? Are you well equipped in the Spirit, or do you remain vulnerable?</p>
		  	<p>When people hear you speak, when they look at your lifestyle, what do they see? Do others see Jesus in you? What fruits have you borne to those around you? Can men really testify that you’ve edified them by your speech, principles or way of life? Does your fruit give a great definition of you?</p>
		  	<p>Beloved, do we bear the fruits of the Spirit, or carnal fruits?</p>
		  	<p>Love, joy, peace, longsuffering, gentleness, goodness, faith, Meekness, temperance, amongst others, are fruits only borne by those who delight in the Spirit.</p>
		  	<p>What we release is as a result of what we have within. Henceforth, deliberately determine to feed yourself with positive life-transforming information. Invest richly the Word of God in your life. Let these reflect in the fruits you bear. Be blessed!</p>
