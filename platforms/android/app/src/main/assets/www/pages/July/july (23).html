		  	<p><i>Not that I speak in respect of want: for I have learned, in whatsoever state I am, therewith to be content. (Philippians 4:11)</i></p>


		  	<blockquote>When you’re constantly confined within the chains of discontentment, you might easily find yourself being lured to a step of compromise. </blockquote>

		  	<p>Paul had experienced so much as a Minister of the Gospel. He had faced persecution, rejection, detention, amongst others; but one thing he learnt over time was contentment.</p>
		  	<p>For him to have made this statement in his letter to the Philippians, he must have realized that it pays to be content. In our study, we will discover the difference between contentment and mediocrity.</p>
		  	<p>Contentment in God is highly rewarding; be content, giving thanks to God in every situation, with an understanding that He will never withhold anything good from you.</p>
		  	<p>When you’re constantly confined within the chains of discontentment, you might easily find yourself being lured to a step of compromise.</p>
		  	<p>When you want things to be done immediately at all cost, without thinking about God’s Divine plans and purpose for your life, you might easily act the wrong way (in compromise), to get it done. Bear in mind that there are repercussions for acting contrary to God’s will and time.</p>
		  	<p>On many occasions, I have spoken to people about contentment, but there’s been a common question that kept on thriving. It is, “should I then be satisfied with my average life, since it is good to be content?” No!</p>
		  	<p>Reading carefully through the lines of this particular scripture reference, <i> “Not that I speak in respect of want:” </i> We realize that Paul was not speaking of contentment in terms of wants and needs, but was addressing selfishness to a large extent.</p>
		  	<p>In essence, it is not bad to want more than you already have; it is alright to desire to soar higher in life. It is commendable to achieve greater than you’ve previously done in life. However, contentment must have its go.</p>
		  	<p>As much as we want to get better, we should remain within the concise of purpose. Because of ambition, aspirations and selfish desires, many have compromised their stand in God. Many have done wrong things to get to right places. All these cannot happen when a heart is contently sold out to God.</p>
		  	<p>Even though I might not yet be at my final destination in life, I still thank God that I’m no longer at my starting point. I’m not going to fold my arms and remain at the point I am now, but I will move as the Lord directs me, with a heart of contentment.</p>
		  	<p>Contentment is not mediocrity! Mediocrity is satisfaction with the average life; contentment is being comfortable in God, and being grateful for all He’s doing in your life.</p>
		  	<p>God does not do things half way. His ways are not average. His works are not ordinary. Therefore, if I embrace contentment in God, I have in no way embraced an average life.</p>
		  	<p>In whatsoever state you are, as long as you have God, be content. With God, things can only get better. Be blessed!</p>
