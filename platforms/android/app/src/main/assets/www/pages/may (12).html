		  	<p><i>Do not be conformed to this world (this age), [fashioned after and adapted to its external, superficial customs], but be transformed (changed) by the [entire] renewal of your mind [by its new ideals and its new attitude], so that you may prove [for yourselves] what is the good and acceptable and perfect will of God, even the thing which is good and acceptable and perfect [in His sight for you]. (Romans 2:2 AMP)</i></p>


		  	<blockquote>Your real strength is portrayed by your ability to be in control of your environment against all odds. Rather than being conformed to it, transform it. </blockquote>

		  	<p>Over recent years, the world has only gotten darker and more corrupt; things which were deemed abominable in the past are now generally accepted and publicly displayed.</p>
		  	<p>There is no more shame in sexual immorality; there is no more shame in pornography. The rate of juvenile delinquency has only increased over time. Old people have derailed from path of truth, and young people have grown into conformity with the system of the world.</p>
		  	<p>The gospel of the Kingdom has been twisted and shaped to suit the people of the world. Preachers are gradually embracing sugar-coated Christianity, in order to retain their members. They are no longer preaching the Word as it is, but as they will have it.</p>
		  	<p>Beloved in such an age, God will rather have us stand out as light, than conform to the darkness. As Sons of God, we should have power over our environment, and not vice-versa. Be the difference the world needs!</p>
		  	<p>Jesus once dwelt in the world; the world was full of ignorant and religious hypocrites. Rather than being carried away and blinded by their ignorance, He remained in God’s will, and showed them the light.</p>
		  	<p>Likewise, we should be able to remain focused, even in the most distracting environment. Your real strength is portrayed by your ability to be in control of your environment against all odds. Rather than being conformed to it, transform it.</p>
		  	<p>Jesus spoke differently, He acted differently, and He lived differently. Likewise, we must not do what every other person in this age is doing. In order for us to know what God’s perfect will for us is, we must choose to live above our environment, by being transformed by the renewal of our minds. It is written:</p>
		  	<p><i>If ye were of the world, the world would love his own: but because ye are not of the world, but I have chosen you out of the world, therefore the world hateth you. (John 15:19)</i></p>
		  	<p>Verily, we are in the world, but not of the world . . . Although we are in the earth, we are not of its system, neither are we of this age. Therefore, be not carried away by the system, but transform the system with the Word of God in your Spirit.</p>
		  	<p>Don’t struggle to be accepted by the world, but walk in God’s acceptable will. Beloved, as Sons of God, we are more than our environments. London should not define your lifestyle; America should not define your lifestyle. As a Son of God, it is an error for your environment to shape your thinking, charisma and life. Only be shaped by God’s Word.</p>
		  	<p>Never accept the saying that life is tough in UK or any other nation; you are the one that defines your environment, and not vice-versa. Never accept the saying that Jobs are difficult to get in any nation; we have the authority to call things that be not as though they were.</p>
		  	<p>Above all things brethren, always bear in mind, that we have been called not to conform, but to transform. Do not be eclipsed by the darkness of this age, rather, outshine its system. Be blessed!</p>
