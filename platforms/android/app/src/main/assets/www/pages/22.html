		  <div class="panel-body" style="text-align:justify">

		  	<p><i>For unto us was the gospel preached, as well as unto them: but the word preached did not profit them, not being mixed with faith in them that heard it. (Hebrews 4:2)</i></p>


		  	<blockquote>Until you begin to receive the Word of God as Rhema, you have not started profiting from it yet.</blockquote>

		  	<p>Pastor Chris Oyakhilome once said, “The Word of God will not work for you until you work it.”</p>
		  	<p>Verily, we cannot profit from the Word of God until we make it profitable. Basically, there are two categories of people in respect to the Word of God. There are people who read the word of God; likewise, there are those who receive it.</p>
		  	<p>Reading the Word of God without any reception may be vain. The positive results of the Word of God emanates from a stirring brought about by the reception of the Word of God as Rhema.</p>
		  	<p>On so many occasions, I communed with the Holy Ghost through the scriptures. Not just because I set out time to read it, but because I meditated on each single Word. Like never before, I admonish you not to just stop at reading the Word, but to continue pondering and meditating on it, until you receive a deeper meaning, and encounter various degrees of light and truth.</p>
		  	<p>Rhema is birthed by your deliberate decision to give valuable time to the Word of God in meditation. I have been to several congregations where the Word of God was preached. Yet I am very sure that not everyone walked out of the congregation with something. The solution to your situation is not solely on the preacher, but on you. In order to receive something tangible, you must be ready to dedicate time and focus to the Word of God.</p>
		  	<p>Until you begin to receive the Word of God as Rhema, you have not started profiting from it yet. Rhema is that force and stirring propelled by the Word of God, which pushes your faith to the next level. It is the dawn of a deeper revelational knowledge from the Word of God, which relates perfectly to your situation, and communes with your Spirit.</p>
		  	<p>So often I read John 3:16; initially, it was only but a mere recitation, thus my Spirit did not really profit from it. I kept on reading it, until one fateful day, when I deliberately decided to ponder and meditate on each word of it. I was amazed with what I saw! It changed my life, thinking and mindset for good.</p>
		  	<p>It pays to receive not just read the word. Reading the word could make you feel good, disciplined and religious, but receiving the Word changes your life for good!</p>
		  	<p>Understand that the Word of God is sharper than any two edged sword. (Hebrews 4:12). Therefore, there’s no situation that the Word of God cannot carefully operate on. But it is even more important to know that this will only apply to you if you’ve not just stopped at reading the Word, but also given valuable time to meditate and receive Rhema.</p>
		  	<p>All you need at any time is just one Word from God; it’s capable of making a great impact. Today, give valuable time to locate that one Word for you in this season, and make a Rhema out of it. Be blessed!</p>
