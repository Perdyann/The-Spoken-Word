		  	<p><i>Then was the king exceedingly glad for him, and commanded that they should take Daniel up out of the den. So Daniel was taken up out of the den, and no manner of hurt was found upon him, because he believed in his God. (Daniel 6:23)</i></p>
		  	

		  	<blockquote>When our actions are propelled by our trust, reliance and belief in God, we are bound to achieve things that are naturally infeasible. </blockquote>

		  	<p>The reason why Daniel went through the lion’s den and was brought out alive; the reason why he had been with the lions, yet was not hurt, is clearly portrayed here — because he believed in his God.</p>
		  	<p>There is so much we can achieve when we believe; we are bound to overcome situations that should ordinarily consume a mere man, when we believe.</p>
		  	<p>Despite the fact that Daniel was aware of the new statute signed, he still prayed because he relied totally on God, and trusted solely in His might.</p>
		  	<p>Many men had been casted into the lion’s den, and only their bones were redeemed; however, when a man of faith, was casted into that same den, his reliance on God brought him out unhurt.</p>
		  	<p>Here’s the summary of it all; when our actions are propelled by our trust, reliance and belief in God, we are bound to achieve things that are naturally infeasible.</p>
		  	<p>Never stop trusting God, don’t let the magnitude of the threat steal your trust. God never promised to keep us free from the den, but to keep us free from danger when we believe. You can be in the den of lions, without being in danger.</p>
		  	<p>Even if God does not stop you from being cast into the den, He will surely keep you from danger. Only believe!</p>
		  	<p>Let the words of our mouth and the meditations of our heart be prompted by our faith, trust, believe, adherence and total reliance in God.</p>
		  	<p>If Daniel did not believe in God, he would have been consumed by the lions; if Shedrach, Meshach and Abednego did not believe in God, they would have been consumed by the fire of oppression. So much happens when we believe.</p>
		  	<p>Things that should have been consumed are often preserved by faith and trust in God.</p>
		  	<p>The king loved Daniel, but still couldn’t save him from the den, because the petition signed was irrevocable; that’s why we should never rely on the arm of flesh. There will come a threat, which not even the king can save you from, but God.</p>
		  	<p>No matter how much men love you, there are things beyond their power to control or handle; trust solely on the Lord, who has the whole world in His hands.</p>
		  	<p>Even when you find yourself in the den, trust God to keep you from the dangers therein. Be blessed!</p>
