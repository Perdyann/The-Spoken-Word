		  	<p><i>Yea, though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil: for thou art with me; thy rod and thy staff they comfort me. (Psalm 23:4)</i></p>

		  	<blockquote>Your real faith is proven by your ability to walk through the valley of the shadow of death, without fearing any evil. Your greatest fear is your greatest fall!</blockquote>

		  	<p>Fear is the enemy of faith; faith makes everything possible, while fear makes everything impossible; through faith, we receive anything, but through fear, we lose everything.</p>
		  	<p>Healing is a product of faith; sickness is a product of fear. When fear gets into the heart of man, the first mission it has to accomplish is to paralyze every iota of faith. Faith is a virtue, but fear is a plague.</p>
		  	<p>The Psalmist declares that even though he walks through the valley of death (a valley that has claimed the lives of many others), he will fear no evil. There’s no doubt that this is the speech of a man of faith.</p>
		  	<p>Pastor E A Adeboye once quoted, “If you fear what others fear, you’d fall where they fell.” How true! Fear leads to a downfall; the valley of death is a place that’s greatly feared — we should not be surprised to know that it has trapped so many.</p>
		  	<p>Your real faith is proven by your ability to walk through the valley of the shadow of death, without fearing any evil. Fear not. Your greatest fear is your greatest fall!</p>
		  	<p>When I was a kid, I couldn’t sleep alone in a room at night because I already had the fear of the powers of darkness. Funny enough, when I was alone in the room, I imagined silly creatures and sounds, but when someone else was there, I was alright.</p>
		  	<p>To me, those creatures and sounds were real and scary, but in no time, I realized that I made up those sounds by my imaginations. Indeed, it was the fear in my heart that made the sounds.</p>
		  	<p>If fear is harbored in your heart, it brings into existence the evil that never existed. Faith is what you need and not fear; can’t you see that the cause of instability in life is fear? Can’t you see that the cause of loss is fear?</p>
		  	<p>The Word of God makes us to understand this—He that is in us is greater than He that is of the world. My question remains, why fear something that is not as great as you? Why fear the valley of death when you are a life giver?</p>
		  	<p>Quite a lot of people have taken actions propelled by fear—they want to gain admission into an institution, but are afraid of being denied, thus, they try to bribe their way through in advance. That’s sheer act of fear!</p>
		  	<p>As long as you keep acting on fear, your life will be defined by instability. Act faith always and not fear.</p>
		  	<p>Romans 14:23 makes us to understand that anything done without faith is sin. Since fear is the opposite of faith, we can conclude that fear is a sin. Yes! I’m certain it is.</p>
		  	<p>You are a man of faith; don’t fear that valley of death which others dread. That’s the difference between the Sons of God, and the children of darkness; when they exhibit fear, we act faith. Be blessed!</p>
