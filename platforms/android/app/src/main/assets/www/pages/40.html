		  	<p><i>And he said, Come. And when Peter was come down out of the ship, he walked on the water, to go to Jesus.</i></p>
		  	<p><i>But when he saw the wind boisterous, he was afraid; and beginning to sink, he cried, saying, Lord, save me. (Matthew 14:29-30)</i></p>
		  	

		  	<blockquote>Fear is the greatest negation of faith. It causes a man to sink, and be derailed by situations which he should ordinarily be in control of</blockquote>

		  	<p>There is nothing that weakens the faith of a man as much as fear does... The water is something that Peter was already walking upon. Right from the moment Peter decided to walk to Jesus on the water, he was above it. It was not until he became afraid, that he began to sink inside something, which he already had dominion of.</p>
		  	<p>Some years back, when I tried to gain admission into several Universities in Nigeria, having been denied a couple of times, we ventured into some desperate means to get it at all cost. My family tried to show their support by accompanying me to the offices several Heads of Departments, to hear my case. Most of these fellows demanded huge sums of money in exchange for the admission, which I rightfully deserved.</p>
		  	<p>One Afternoon, as I sat down thinking about my situation, my little sister walked up to me and said, “You don’t have faith... You fear!” When she began to make me see reasons why I was fearful, I admitted to her opinion.</p>
		  	<p>She said further, “The admission list is not out yet, but you are already running around to compromise your faith, looking for who to pay in exchange for favour. This is for no other reason than the fear of being denied admission another time.”</p>
		  	<p>I was astonished! Indeed, in that season, it was fear and not faith that prompted my actions. Each time I thought of the possibility of my application being revoked, fear led me to handle things the wrong way. In no time, I began to understand faith.</p>
		  	<p>I didn’t need to run around seeking the help of men anymore... I resorted to staying in my abode, seeking the will of God, in faith. That was where my Victory laid. As it is written,</p>
		  	<p><i>For whatsoever is born of God overcometh the world: and this is the victory that overcometh the world, even our faith. (1 John 5:4)</i></p>
		  	<p>Although, by our birth-rights, we should overcome the world, this would not be a reality until our faith comes to act. Faith is that victory that overcomes the world! But this is easily weakened by fear.</p>
		  	<p>Faith is the assurance of things hoped for . . . Fear is the expectation of the most dreadful occurrence. It is the greatest irony of our faith.</p>
		  	<p>There is nothing that kills an ailing person faster than fear. Is our prayer motivated by faith or fear?</p>
		  	<p>There are some challenges, which I’d rather face alone, because different companions have ways of depositing fear in the heart of man. Get rid of the companion that paralyzes your faith with fear.</p>
		  	<p>When I had so much faith that I was going to receive something, which I desired, someone walked up to me and said, “They’ve never granted this to anyone, I don’t think you can receive it” Indeed, there was nothing that could thwart my result faster than harbouring such thoughts of fear.</p>
		  	<p>Beloved, fear is the greatest negation of faith. It causes a man to sink, and be derailed by situations which he should ordinarily be in control of (Just like Peter).</p>
		  	<p>Hence forth, let your actions, prayers and charisma be shaped by faith and not fear. Say an intercessory prayer of faith today. More grace!</p>
