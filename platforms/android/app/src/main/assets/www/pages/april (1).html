		  <div class="panel-body" style="text-align:justify">


		  	<p><i>According as his divine power hath given unto us all things that pertain unto life and godliness, through the knowledge of him that hath called us to glory and virtue: </i></p>
		  	<p><i>Whereby are given unto us exceeding great and precious promises: that by these ye might be partakers of the divine nature, having escaped the corruption that is in the world through lust. (2 Peter 1:3-4)</i></p>


		  	<blockquote>Unless you get to know your identity in Christ, you will easily be swept around by every wind and doctrine.</blockquote>

		  	<p>Time will not permit; space will not contain; great emphasis might not be able to fully describe the power of knowledge. The power of a man to possess all things, and reign is ineffective without knowledge.</p>
		  	<p>Some versions quote, “Through this promise you can have gods own life in you.” Having God’s Life in you places you above sickness, poverty, failure and disappointment. It qualifies you to be victor. Can we ask for anything better?</p>
		  	<p>However, we must understand that all these come through knowledge. Being a partaker of Gods divine nature, having all things and being partakers of the great promise is only activated through Knowledge.</p>
		  	<p>Shedrach Meshach and Abednego knew their God enough, not to compromise for anything below standard. Beloved, to what extent do you know your God, and yourself? It is only through the knowledge of Him that called us to glory, that we have God’s own life in us.</p>
		  	<p>As Sons of God, we have a great inheritance! We’ve got a befitting status; such that places us in a position to reign in health, prosperity, grace and power. We have a Divine Status that places us above the worldly system, rules and principles. We are the only ones not limited to the protocols of nature and science. However, the height of all that we could ever do with that is silenced by the lack of knowledge.</p>
		  	<p>Our Divine call to glory and virtue is only activated by knowledge. It is written;</p>
		  	<p><i>Now I say, That the heir, as long as he is a child, differeth nothing from a servant, though he be lord of all;</i></p>
		  	<p><i>But is under tutors and governors until the time appointed of the father.</i></p>
		  	<p><i>Even so we, when we were children, were in bondage under the elements of the world: (Galatians 4:1-3)</i></p>
		  	<p>Beloved, children are ignorant of a lot of things! That’s why a child can never access his inheritance until he is grown to a certain age, when probably, he must have gained enough wisdom, knowledge and understanding.</p>
		  	<p>Likewise brethren, we can never really gain access to all the things that God has in store for us, except through knowledge. Unless you get to know your identity in Christ, you will easily be swept around by every wind and doctrine. Knowledge is essential! Again it is written:</p>
		  	<p><i>My people are destroyed for lack of knowledge: (Hosea 4:6)</i></p>
		  	<p>If God’s own people can be destroyed for lack of knowledge, then it is evident, that no matter how honorable you regard yourself as, without knowledge, you are liable to destruction.</p>
		  	<p>We are the people of God; the chosen, royal and peculiar people (1 Peter 2:9). If we can be guided by knowledge, there is no limit to the height we can attain.</p>
		  	<p>There are aspects of knowledge. Just as there is the human knowledge, which is natural and limited, there is also revelation knowledge; this is Spiritual, unlimited and glorious! It is the knowledge that is established from meditating constantly on the Word of God, and praying in the Spirit. It is written,</p>
		  	<p><i>But the anointing which ye have received of him abideth in you, and ye need not that any man teach you: but as the same anointing teacheth you of all things, and is truth, and is no lie, and even as it hath taught you, ye shall abide in him. (1 John 2:27)</i></p>
		  	<p>Human knowledge is gained by natural experiences and from lectures by tutors. However, Spiritual knowledge is in-built; it is prompted by a stirring of the anointing. When we spend time alone in our place of worship, and meditate on God’s Word, the Spirit teaches us things too deep for the natural mind to comprehend.</p>
		  	<p>Beloved, you cannot grow in knowledge when you don’t dedicate quality time to meditate, renew your mind, and pray in the Holy Ghost. Don’t rely only on what you learn from sermons. There is something that was not mentioned in the sermon, which God wants to reveal directly to you in your private time.</p>
		  	<p>Grow in knowledge; it is powerful!</p>
