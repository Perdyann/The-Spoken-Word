		  	<p><i>No temptation has overtaken you that is not common to man. God is faithful, and he will not let you be tempted beyond your ability, but with the temptation he will also provide the way of escape, that you may be able to endure it. (1 Corinthians 10:13)</i></p>
		

		  	<blockquote>When you are caught up in the wilderness, seeking a way out, you must understand that someone has passed through that same wilderness.</blockquote>

		  	<p>In the struggle to overcome diverse temptations, yet giving in to it so easily, many have embraced the thought that temptations are irresistible.</p>
		  	<p>Despite how hard you might have struggled in your ability, to keep yourself free from falling, you still fell. Sometimes, it seems like you have overcome already, but just when you thought it got better, another mistake was made.</p>
		  	<p>Many have been held bound by all kinds of addictions and bad habits; they really don’t want to indulge in such anymore, but so easily find themselves entangled in it. The struggle to deal with such habits have left many exhausted, and led many to give up on their chances of overcoming.</p>
		  	<p>In times of temptation, there are just a few things, which we need to realize in order to overcome.</p>
		  	<p>To start with, no temptation has overtaken you that is not common to man. When you are caught up in the wilderness, seeking a way out, you must understand that someone has passed through that same wilderness.</p>
		  	<p>Poverty has tempted some people to sell their souls to the devil for fame and fortune; what they fail to realize is that Jesus was tempted in like manner; the devil took Jesus to a high mountain and offered to give him the kingdoms of the world and their glory, if only He will worship him.</p>
		  	<p>If Jesus could overcome such temptation, and we have the same Spirit, which dwelled in Him, then there is no reason why we cannot overcome. If someone has faced that temptation before you, you can also subdue it.</p>
		  	<p>Furthermore, <i> he will not let you be tempted beyond your ability. </i> Verily, that temptation is not beyond your ability. We are assured by this Word that we have an edge over every temptation we face. If the temptation was beyond our ability, God will not let us be tempted in that measure.</p>
		  	<p>Rejoice beloved, God allowed the devil to tempt Jesus, because He knew that the temptation was not beyond His ability. Likewise, if God has allowed you to be tempted this way, then remain confident in the truth that it is not beyond your ability.</p>
		  	<p>Finally beloved, <i>he will also provide the way of escape. </i> There is a way out of every wilderness; there is no problem, without a solution. That temptation you face, has got a way out, so don’t give up yet. Jesus is the way!</p>
		  	<p>Some people struggled with habits for decades before they discovered their way out in Jesus; many have been made free after many years of addiction; no matter how long you have been in it, you can still get out of it.</p>
		  	<p>I cannot tell you that if you want to quit smoking, decide not to spend a dime on cigarettes again; it’s won’t be so easy. Jesus is the way! When you are made free by Jesus, even if a thousand packs of cigarettes were offered to you freely, you will gladly reject them.</p>
		  	<p>Beloved, you can endure all things when Jesus is in charge of your life. He is the way out of every addiction and habit. In times of temptation, remember that you have a way out in Jesus. Be blessed!</p>
