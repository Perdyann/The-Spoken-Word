		  <div class="panel-body" style="text-align:justify">


		  	<p><i>Dead flies cause the ointment of the apothecary to send forth a stinking savour: so doth a little folly him that is in reputation for wisdom and honour. (Ecclesiastes 10:1)</i></p>

		  	<blockquote>You can never turn your back on God, and remain who you used to be when you walked in Him.</blockquote>

		  	<p>Just like dead flies perch into an oil, and cause it to stink, making it useless, so does the entrance of a little folly destroy the reputation of a wise man.</p>
		  	<p>Solomon was wise in every way; He was a man, whom God had blessed with wisdom like no other; wisdom was his initial request, but God ensured every other thing was added unto him, such that he lacked nothing.</p>
		  	<p>His Wisdom attracted the Queen of Sheba to his abode. The whole world heard of his great words of wisdom, acts of judgment and witty song and proverbs. He was one of a kind.</p>
		  	<p>Howbeit, in his latter days, more folly was displayed than wisdom. The very thing God commanded him not to do was what he delighted in. It is written:</p>
		  	<p><i>And Solomon did evil in the sight of the Lord, and went not fully after the Lord, as did David his father.</i></p>
		  	<p><i>And the Lord was angry with Solomon, because his heart was turned from the Lord God of Israel, which had appeared unto him twice, (1 Kings 11:6&9)</i></p>
		  	<p>Solomon, being a man of Wisdom, knew the right things to do, but intentionally failed to do them. Despite the Lords appearance and warning to him, he deliberately refused to heed.</p>
		  	<p>Here’s the point: it is not enough to know the wise things to do; true wisdom emanates from doing right. True wisdom emanates from fear and obedience to God.</p>
		  	<p>Solomon knew exactly what to do, but he had grown too wise that he embraced negligence. He felt too knowledgeable, that he turned away from the Lord.</p>
		  	<p>Just as the scripture referenced today, which was penned by Solomon, rightly portrays, Solomon, being a man of wisdom, gave a little entrance to folly, and this ruined his reputation.</p>
		  	<p>Solomon had been through it all; he had acted in wisdom and also in folly, but in all he admits, wisdom is the principal thing!</p>
		  	<p>He had heeded to the voice of the Lord, and he had turned away in folly, but at the end he concludes, Fear God!</p>
		  	<p>A man can never be wiser than God; Solomon had gained fame and built a reputation for his wisdom that he felt wise enough to make decisions for himself, and neglect the covenant of God.</p>
		  	<p>What he failed to realize then was that God is the source of wisdom; when your relationship with God and connection to Him is impaired, wisdom ceases to flow. You can never really be wise without God.</p>
		  	<p>You can never turn your back on God, and remain who you used to be when you walked in Him. Wisdom is the principal thing, but it can only be accessed in God.</p>
		  	<p>There’s so much to learn from Solomon; knowing the right thing, without doing it defines folly. Deserting the source for the content, rips you off everything; a reputation established over the years can be tarnished by a little entrance of folly and negligence.</p>
		  	<p>Guard your ointment by keeping it away from flies; guard your reputation by resisting folly. Be blessed!</p>
