		  	<p><i>Let your loins be girded about, and your lights burning; </i></p>
		  	<p><i>And ye yourselves like unto men that wait for their lord, when he will return from the wedding; that when he cometh and knocketh, they may open unto him immediately. (Luke 12:35-36)</i></p>
		  	
		  	<blockquote>Every man can tell you his date of birth, but no one is certain when his last day will be. Be ready always!</blockquote>

		  	<p>Ten virgins waited for the arrival of the bridegroom, but only five of them had spare oil; ten virgins waited for the bridegroom, but only five of them had their lights burning; ten virgins waited for the bridegroom, but only five of them were ready.</p>
		  	<p>Today, we are admonished to be ever ready and watchful. It is easy to miss out on a blessing or divine package, which you are not ready to receive; it is easy to lose an opportunity, which you are not ready to grasp.</p>
		  	<p>So often we hear people say, “Live every second of life as though it were your last.” Every man can tell you his date of birth, but no one is certain when his last day will be. Be ready always!</p>
		  	<p>Some say, “let me enjoy my youthful days in worldly pleasures, and I’d be reconciled to God when I’m old and retired.” Many die as youths and not many get to live till they are old and retired. There is no better time to be ready and watchful than now.</p>
		  	<p>Readiness is not about going to church and trying to abstain from ungodly acts; it transcends such consciousness. Readiness is a thing of staying in God’s Presence constantly; it shapes you to be what you ought to be.</p>
		  	<p>For every season in a man’s life, there are trials and challenges to be faced, there are blessings and provisions to be received, and there are new heights to be attained. A man needs to be filled with the Holy Ghost, and devoted to God, in order to discern the times and the seasons.</p>
		  	<p>How will you be able to hear what God is saying about this season, when have not studied the bible or prayed in the Holy Ghost for days? Beloved, redeem the time for the days are evil (Ephesians 5:16); we need to be ready and watchful in order not to be caught unawares.</p>
		  	<p>God needs your attention even more than you need His. God needs you to hear Him even more than you want Him to hear you. He needs your time much more than you need His.</p>
		  	<p>The enemy is moving around like a roaring lion, seeking the slightest opportunity to take advantage of children of the kingdom. People, who are not ready and watchful, have been thwarted as preys of the enemy.</p>
		  	<p>Will you be ready when the Lord shall come? It could be now. The world is not our final resting place, set your gaze on that, which is above, and be shaped by your Divine purpose. Be blessed!</p>
