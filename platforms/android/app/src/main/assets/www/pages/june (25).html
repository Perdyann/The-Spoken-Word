		  	<p><i>For he saith to Moses, I will have mercy on whom I will have mercy, and I will have compassion on whom I will have compassion.</i></p>
		  	<p><i>So then it is not of him that willeth, nor of him that runneth, but of God that sheweth mercy. (Romans 9:15-16)</i></p>
		 


		  	<blockquote>Our human will or effort is not capable of catapulting us to the realm of our destiny, but the mercies of God alone.</blockquote>

		  	<p>One beautiful morning, I woke up to the reality of God’s mercies. It was such a feeling I had not experienced before. Having a flash back in memory, to the years past, I could only praise God for His mercies.</p>
		  	<p>Looking back at where God’s mercy located me from, tears rolled down my cheeks. At that point, I did not care about anything else; all that filled my heart was unspeakable joy. Many Christians are more full of complains than thanksgiving. If only you get to realize the magnitude of what God has already done for you, you will never complain again.</p>
		  	<p>We are who we are today, because of the mercies of God; no matter how unpleasant your situation is today, there is still a worse situation, which you could have been caught up in, had it not been for God’s mercies.</p>
		  	<p>Even if I had nothing to thank God for, I will thank him for salvation. Many have died in their iniquity, ever wondered what anguish their souls will face through eternity?</p>
		  	<p>Even if I had no food to eat, I will thank God for the ability to eat. Many cannot eat even if they had food . . . some are only fed through drips and pipes.</p>
		  	<p>Even if I had no shoes to wear, I will thank God that I have legs. Many have no legs to wear shoes.</p>
		  	<p>It is high time we realize that in every situation, there is always something to thank God for. Someone once said, “I might not yet be where I want to be, but thank God I am not where I used to be.” Thank God for His mercies!</p>
		  	<p>Sometimes, we make a mistake of thinking that our determination, hard-work or ability has led us thus far; what we fail to realize is that many people, who have been more determined, hardworking and able than us, have not in any way measured up to our level of success.</p>
		  	<p>As the scripture rightly states, our human will or effort is not capable of catapulting us to the realm of our destiny, but the mercies of God alone.</p>
		  	<p>Jacob and Esau were twins. Even though Jacob was younger than Esau by birth, God’s mercy placed him above.</p>
		  	<p>Joseph was younger than his jealous brothers, but God’s mercy placed him in a position, that made his elder brothers to submit to him.</p>
		  	<p>David was the youngest of Jesses sons, but God’s mercy chose him for an oil and anointing that his elder brothers were not qualified for; God’s mercy gave him a battle that the entire nation were too scared to fight.</p>
		  	<p>All you need to be successful in an interview is God’s mercy; all you need to be the best academically is God’s mercy; all you need to be victorious is God’s mercy.</p>
		  	<p>Rather than worrying over what you don’t have, thank God for His mercies. His mercy can grant you something, which money, strength and ability cannot give. Be blessed!</p>
