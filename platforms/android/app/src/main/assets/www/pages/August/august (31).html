		  	<p><i>Cast thy burden upon the LORD, and he shall sustain thee: he shall never suffer the righteous to be moved. (Psalm 55:22)</i></p>

		  	<blockquote>The knowledge of your identity, will unlock hidden potentials within you. You might never know how far you can go, until you understand who you are.</blockquote>

		  	<p>The Word of God never gives an assurance that the righteous will not be afflicted; we are not assured of being free from trials and persecution; at some point, we might have burdens to bear. But in all these, one thing remains certain—we are immovable, unshakable, and undefeatable.</p>
		  	<p>The difference between the righteous and every other man is not the trials we face, but our victory over them. The ordinary man is moved, shaken and defeated by petty trials, but the spiritual man is made stronger by them.</p>
		  	<p>When you understand that trials cannot move or break you, you will cease to fret.</p>
		  	<p>The storms of life will surely roar ferociously against you; the wind will rush forcefully towards your direction; the fiery furnace will be heated up seven times for your sake. But of what concern is it to you, when you’re assured that you cannot be moved?</p>
		  	<p>Shedrach, Meshach and Abednego might have been worried, had they not known that they were unburnable. Daniel might have been scared of the lions, had he not known that he was inconsumable.</p>
		  	<p>Beloved, the understanding and knowledge of your identity, will unlock hidden potentials within you. You might never know how far you can go, until you understand who you are.</p>
		  	<p>We are the righteousness of God, not by our works, but by grace. A born-again man is more than just ordinary.</p>
		  	<p>The fiery furnace can be heated ten times, but as long as I know I’m unburnable, I cannot be worried or scared; the storms can roar against me, but as long as I know that my boat is immovable, I’m not bothered; the trial can reach its peak, but as long as I know that I am undefeatable, I remain confident.</p>
		  	<p>The Word of God does not lie; if it says that the righteous shall never be moved, defeated, and shaken, why then should the righteous worry or fear?</p>
		  	<p>We operate by a different set of rules; the fire might be hot enough to burn ordinary men, but not us. The storms might be strong enough to move and capsize the boats of ordinary men, but not ours. The trials might be tough enough to defeat mere men, but not us. We are unburnable, immovable, and undefeatable.</p>
		  	<p>The rainstorm might overturn a house founded on normal soil; but as long as the Lord is our root and foundation, we remain immovable, come rain or shine.</p>
		  	<p>Beloved, do not fret like mere men do, but have faith in this word: the Lord will never let the righteous fall, fail, be moved or defeated. Be blessed!</p>
