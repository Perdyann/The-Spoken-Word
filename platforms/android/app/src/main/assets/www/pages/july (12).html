		  	<p><i>So he brought down the people unto the water: and the LORD said unto Gideon, Every one that lappeth of the water with his tongue, as a dog lappeth, him shalt thou set by himself; likewise every one that boweth down upon his knees to drink.</i></p>
		  	<p><i>And the LORD said unto Gideon, By the three hundred men that lapped will I save you, and deliver the Midianites into thine hand: and let all the other people go every man unto his place. (Judges 7:5&7)</i></p>

		  	<blockquote>Until you pass through the screening stage, you can never walk into your destiny.</blockquote>

		  	<p>There are some phases I desired to experience in my life; I was convinced that I will get there someday, but someday seemed like an everlasting word. At a point I wondered if I was really ready to experience that phase of life; I was uncertain whether or not I was prepared for it.</p>
		  	<p>Desiring to be transposed to that phase instantly, I always admitted readiness within myself. However, admitting that I was ready was not enough reason for God to automatically launch me into that phase, my readiness needed to be proven at the screening stage.</p>
		  	<p>Claiming to be ready is not enough justification for you to proceed to the warfront, there’s got to be a test to prove your readiness. This is called the screening stage.</p>
		  	<p>Notice, after thirty two thousand men had been told to return home if they were fearful, twenty two thousand returned, but the remaining ten thousand men claimed to be fearless and ready. Their claim was not enough to qualify them to stand in the battle field; they had to prove it by the water.</p>
		  	<p>The water was the stage at which every man was screened; their reaction at that stage determined their direction in life.</p>
		  	<p>Only two outcomes are expected after the screening stage — either you’re sent back home to meet the fearful; or you’re sent to the battle field to obtain victory. The choice is yours to make.</p>
		  	<p>Those who bowed down on their knees to drink were sent home; bowing on their knees to drink water was a sign of unreadiness; it portrayed how unwatchful they were, despite their claims to be ready. For this reason, they were sent home.</p>
		  	<p>However, those who lapped the water and drank from their palms proved by their actions their level of readiness.</p>
		  	<p>At the end of the screening stage, it was proven that only three hundred, out of the ten thousand men, who claimed to be ready, were truly prepared.</p>
		  	<p>Until you pass through the screening stage, you can never walk into your destiny. Babies cannot be given bones to chew until they’ve proven their ability to eat solid food.</p>
		  	<p>Verily, you cannot get to the war-front to fight for victory, when you’ve not proven your readiness at the screening stage. It is written:</p>
		  	<p><i>For many are called, but few are chosen. (Matthew 22:14) Do not rejoice in that you have been called for a feast; </i></p>
		  	<p>Do not rejoice in that you have been called for a feast; rather, get ready and prepared for it. Being called is not enough qualification to be chosen; thirty two thousand men were called, but at the end of the screening stage, only three hundred were chosen.</p>
		  	<p>Be among the chosen! If only one person is to be chosen from a multitude, be that one. Don’t just claim to be ready like the ten thousand men did, but ensure you’re among the chosen three hundred.</p>
		  	<p>Many things happen at the screening stage; be wise enough to be alert and watchful, lest you disqualify yourself by your actions. Always remember, the screening stage determines your next course; be ready for it. Stay blessed!</p>
