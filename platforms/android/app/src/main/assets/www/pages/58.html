		  	<p><i>Come now therefore, and let us slay him, and cast him into some pit, and we will say, Some evil beast hath devoured him: and we shall see what will become of his dreams. (Genesis 37:20)</i></p>


		  	<blockquote>If they don’t persecute you, and throw you into the prison, you may never meet that opportunity that will release you to the palace. </blockquote>

		  	<p>Your real enemies are not those people who are after you as an individual, but those who are after nullifying the greatness in you. In any discussion about dreams, the mention of Joseph is inevitable.</p>
		  	<p>He was a dreamer, known for his dreams and interpretation of the dreams of many. The more of Joseph’s dreams he shared, the more hatred was stirred up against him.</p>
		  	<p>Joseph’s brothers were not necessarily after killing him, but killing his dreams. If his death was enough to give them satisfaction, they would have killed him. However, they just needed to kill his dreams, and overshadow his greatness, that’s why they easily resorted to selling him. This is evident when they said, <i> “ ... and we shall see what will become of his dreams.”</i></p>
		  	<p>Nevertheless, I am always overjoyed to fathom the truth that the evil perpetrated by his brothers, was God’s plan to release him to the place of his greatness in due time.</p>
		  	<p>As great as Joseph’s dreams may have been, the fulfilment may not have been possible in his father’s house. God sought to set Joseph apart for greatness, by separating him from his family for a moment. I am thrilled to comprehend the truth that his own enemies were the instruments used to usher him into the next phase of his life.</p>
		  	<p>Indeed, Joseph’s brothers thought that they were killing his dreams by selling him off, little did they know, that they were building his dreams, by releasing him into the realm of its fulfilment. If it hadn’t been for his envious brothers, the story of his metamorphosis may not have been so soothing. Indeed, our enemies are instruments of purpose. It is written;</p>
		  	<p><i>Thou preparest a table before me in the presence of mine enemies: thou anointest my head with oil; my cup runneth over. (Psalm 23:5)</i></p>
		  	<p>And as I read this, I wondered—my enemies? Why not my friends?—No sooner had I pondered on this thought than I realised that our enemies are instruments of purpose. The very things which God desires to happen to us, in fulfilment of our purpose, are often done by our enemies, but with the wrong intention. It eventually reveals the fact that God turns everything around for our good.</p>
		  	<p>Indeed, when the greatness of Joseph was manifest, a table was prepared for him in the presence of his brothers (enemies). (Genesis 43:32)</p>
		  	<p>God’s original plan for Joseph was brought to a reality through his enemies, who unknowingly acted in line with his purpose, but with the wrong intention.</p>
		  	<p>Beloved, when men revile you, persecute you, and make life miserable for you, understand that they are only instruments of purpose.</p>
		  	<p>Joseph met his lucky day in the prison when he interpreted the dreams of his inmates. If he was never in the prison, he may not have found his way to the palace. Likewise, if they don’t persecute you, and throw you into the prison, you may never meet that opportunity that will release you to the palace.</p>
		  	<p>Don’t hate your enemies. Love them! (Matthew 5:44) These fellows are unknowingly serving God’s purpose for our lives with wrong intentions. Though they mean it for evil, God will always turn it around for our good. Be blessed!</p>
