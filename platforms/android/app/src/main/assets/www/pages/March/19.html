		  	<p><i>Finally, brethren, whatsoever things are true, whatsoever things are honest, whatsoever things are just, whatsoever things are pure, whatsoever things are lovely, whatsoever things are of good report; if there be any virtue, and if there be any praise, think on these things. (Philippians 4:8)</i></p>

		  	<blockquote>There is no greater truth and no better report, than the Word of God. Don’t waste time thinking on facts, when there is a greater truth. </blockquote>

		  	<p>Your thoughts matter a lot! What you think about, is what you will eventually speak about and act upon. In order for a man to act and speak rightly, his thoughts must be channeled on the right things.</p>
		  	<p>We have no time to waste, pondering on falsified, defiling, or negative reports. These thoughts can never bear the right fruits in you.</p>
		  	<p>When the Doctor gives you a report that suggests any atom of ailment, beloved you shouldn’t consider it true enough to think upon. We are partakers of God’s Divine Nature... our nature forbids ailment, thus, any report about ailment is not true.</p>
		  	<p>There is a difference between truth and facts. The Doctors report portrays facts, but there is something greater than facts; it is the truth of God’s Word.</p>
		  	<p>What we should rather think upon is the good report; the report of the Lord!</p>
		  	<p>Whose report is worth your time; the Doctor’s report or God’s own? The Doctor gives you a natural report that portrays the physical state of your body. Whereas, God’s report is supernatural, and it states the Divine nature of our being; thereby counterfeiting any negative natural report.</p>
		  	<p>The knowledge of a Doctor is limited to nature, facts and science, but God’s Word knows no limit whatsoever! Brethren, we are above all natural rules and worldly principles!</p>
		  	<p>We’ve got a Divine Status that makes us extra-ordinary. Based on this, we are no longer subject to the rules and system of the World. We are in the world, but operate by a different system. Thus, our wealth is no longer determined by the economy of the world, but by the nature of Zion. It is written:</p>
		  	<p><i>When men are cast down, then thou shalt say, There is lifting up; and he shall save the humble person. (Job 22:29)</i></p>
		  	<p>Beloved, we are not mere men! We are no longer subject to the rules that define an ordinary man. Hence, what an ordinary man may consider being true, honest, lovely, of good report, virtuous and full of praise; we will boldly denounce.</p>
		  	<p>Our definition of truth differs from that of the world, because we no longer operate by nature, but by divinity. If indeed we are not of the world, why then, as though we are mere men of the world, should we think, speak and act upon worldly facts?</p>
		  	<p>Brethren, our thoughts should be channeled towards Divinity, virtue and praise, in all holiness. If there is anything we should meditate, speak, and act upon, let it be the Word of God.</p>
		  	<p>There is no greater truth and no better report, than the Word of God. Don’t waste time thinking on facts, when there is a greater truth.</p>
		  	<p>Beloved, dedicate quality time to meditate, declare and act upon the Word of God; therein lays virtue, praise, truth, and strength. Be blessed!</p>
