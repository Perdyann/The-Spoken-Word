		  <div class="panel-body" style="text-align:justify">

		  	<p><i>Not every one that saith unto me, Lord, Lord, shall enter into the kingdom of heaven; but he that doeth the will of my Father which is in heaven. (Matthew 7:21)</i></p>
		  


		  	<blockquote>Anything done outside the will of God is iniquity. Any service rendered outside the will of God is automatically disqualified! </blockquote>

		  	<p>This passage clearly portrays one significant truth in which I delight—Every man’s desire is to enter into the Kingdom of heaven someday . . . It is for this reason that we dare to run a good race and fight a good fight of faith. However, the issue most people fail to understand is the order of criteria which must be met.</p>
		  	<p>Quite alright, every man must first accept the Lord as his personal Lord and savior. But sincerely, it doesn’t stop there. This passage gives light to the truth that not everyone who has accepted Christ as his personal Lord, and not everyone who calls Him, “Lord, Lord” shall enter into the Kingdom of heaven. There is more to it.</p>
		  	<p>Do you do the will of the Father in heaven? Our spiritual race does not stop at accepting the Lord. That’s just the beginning . . . there’s more to it. Accepting the Lord has to come from the heart. Accepting the Lord means yielding yourself totally to God. In essence, you no longer have a will of your own. The will of the Father becomes your own will and utmost desire.</p>
		  	<p>So many Christians and even Ministers are serving themselves in the name of serving God. The issue we sometimes fail to understand is that we are on earth for no other reason than to do the will of the Father. That’s why on the last day, nothing else can fetch you the reward of entering into the Kingdom of heaven, than yielding yourself to the will of God</p>
		  	<p>Here’s a personal assessment — For a second, ask yourself this. “Is what I am doing now, and where I intend going the will of God, or just my desire?” Sometimes, we take decisions and actions contrary to God’s will simply because we feel like doing it.</p>
		  	<p>Beloved, even Jesus had to yield himself to the will of the Father in heaven. Do you recall this prayer He made?—</p>
		  	<p><i>“And he went a little farther, and fell on his face, and prayed, saying, O my Father, if it be possible, let this cup pass from me: nevertheless not as I will, but as thou wilt.” (Matthew 26:39).</i></p>
		  	<p>This was a perfect submission to the will of God. In as much as Jesus wanted the cup to pass Him by, he had to prioritize the will of the Father. Do you prioritize the will of the Father in your Ministry, Family, Job, Studies and Affairs?</p>
		  	<p>Until you get to the point of prioritizing the will of the Father, you have not started yet! Sequel to the scripture above, Jesus clearly states, <i> “And then will I profess unto them, I never knew you: depart from me, ye that work iniquity.” (vs. 23). </i> We must understand that anything done outside the will of God is iniquity.</p>
		  	<p>King Saul decided to save some goods of the Amalekites in order to make a sacrifice to God. He failed to realize that acting contrary to the will of God is a deliberate service of self. Even though this seemed like the most perfect thing to do, in the eyes of God, it was the height of iniquity. Any service rendered outside the will of God is automatically disqualified!</p>
		  	<p>We are admonished to acknowledge the Lord in all our ways and steps that our paths may be made straight (Proverbs 3:16). Until you learn to acknowledge the Lord in all your steps, and prioritize the will of the Father, you’d continually tread on a crooked path. Be blessed!</p>
