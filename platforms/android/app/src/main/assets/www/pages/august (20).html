		  	<p><i>Jesus Christ (the Messiah) is [always] the same, yesterday, today, [yes] and forever (to the ages). (Hebrews 13:8 AMP)</i></p>


		  	<blockquote>The only hindrance is the mind; the spirit cannot receive something that the mind deliberately hinders</blockquote>

		  	<p>So many people have doubted the possibility of the manifestation of the power of God, in such magnitude as it was in the time of Jesus. People keep wondering, “could those kinds of miracles that Jesus did be performed in this era?”</p>
		  	<p>Jesus breathed life on dead situations, and cursed the fruitless tree to dry up; He walked on water, and changed water to wine; He healed all manner of sicknesses, and raised the dead; He fixed back to proper functioning, an ear that had been cut off, even without a surgery.</p>
		  	<p>The power of God has manifested greatly, even in this age, but is not so comparable to the time of old. This has made people to think that God has changed or refrained.</p>
		  	<p>The change is not from God, but the mind of the people.</p>
		  	<p>However, by this Word today, we are assured that Jesus Christ is the same and will forever remain the same. In essence, the same aura of power that gushed out from Jesus and gave life to dead situations is still available to even do greater in this age.</p>
		  	<p>Everything that was ever done by God in the past can be done today. The power of God does not depreciate, and God cannot be exhausted. Little wonder Jesus said,</p>
		  	<p><i>Verily, verily, I say unto you, He that believeth on me, the works that I do shall he do also; and greater works than these shall he do; because I go unto my Father. (John 14:12)</i></p>
		  	<p>Indeed, we have been divinely enabled to do the works that Jesus did, and even greater.</p>
		  	<p>Jesus performed great miracles because the power of God was fully vested on him. That same power has been translated to us through the Holy Ghost, after the resurrection and ascension of Christ.</p>
		  	<p>Beloved, He is the same! If He could give life to dead beings previously, then there is nothing that hinders dead situations from receiving life today; if the sick were healed of all sorts of infirmities in the past, then there is no infirmity that cannot be healed today, for He is the same!</p>
		  	<p>The only hindrance is the mind; the spirit cannot receive something that the mind deliberately hinders.</p>
		  	<p>As long as you have that mindset, which dictates that the power of God cannot be manifested in the same way today, as it was previously; then you cannot receive it.</p>
		  	<p>You need to believe that God is unchangeable; if He did it in the past, He can still do it now. Do you believe it? Do you have faith? Receive it and remain blessed!</p>
