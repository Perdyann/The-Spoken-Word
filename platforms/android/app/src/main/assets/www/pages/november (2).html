		  	<p><i>And be not conformed to this world: but be ye transformed by the renewing of your mind, that ye may prove what is that good, and acceptable, and perfect, will of God. (Romans 12:2)</i></p>

		  	<blockquote>Transformation is the purpose of having a renewed mind; there is no point renewing your mind with thoughts that are not capable of transforming you. </blockquote>

		  	<p>This scripture portrays the importance of being constantly transformed by the renewal of our minds. Verily, there are ideas and thoughts that get into the mind, which does more harm than good; likewise, our minds are transformed by some other ideas and thoughts.</p>
		  	<p>Our focus today will be on the contents of the heart, and its effect on our lives. Since it is so important for us to be transformed by the renewal of our minds, I can rightly state that there is no point renewing your mind with thoughts that are not capable of transforming you.</p>
		  	<p>Transformation is the purpose of having a renewed mind; here’s where we analyze information and revelation, with an understanding of their purposes and differences.</p>
		  	<p>A man can have enough information, but still be conformed to the world; however, it is impossible to see a man, who walks by revelation, but is still shaped by the affairs of the world.</p>
		  	<p>Information loads a man’s heart with earthly knowledge, principles, doctrines and thoughts; it educates a man in all fields, but never transforms him.</p>
		  	<p>On the contrary, Revelation transforms a man. It is the quickening of a man’s spirit by the power of God’s Word, which opens his mind to deeper spiritual insights and truth.</p>
		  	<p>Many people read the bible, but get different things from it; while others meditate intently on it, some merely flip through the pages as though it were a novel. As a result, some are informed, while others are transformed.</p>
		  	<p>In the scripture today, we are not just admonished to renew our minds, but to ensure that the renewing of our mind yields transformation. Seeing then that transformation cannot occur by mere information but revelation, what manner of persons ought we to be? Men of revelation!</p>
		  	<p>I tell you one thing — anything God says to you is a revelation, but the words, which men say to you, are mere information. God’s Word transforms, but the words of men only keeps you informed and perhaps educated. Therefore, it is important that we spend more time hearing from God, than we spend listening to men.</p>
		  	<p>Here’s an instance of the contrast between information and revelation. Back in the years, when I was in school, our teachers always taught us that we inhale oxygen and exhale carbon dioxide. This educated me, but never transformed me.</p>
		  	<p>As time went on, I began to study more of God’s Word, and one day I realized something new. When God breathed on man, he received life; In essence, life is what goes out of the nostrils of a spiritual man (since we have the same nature with God).</p>
		  	<p>From the moment I understood this, I knew that there was more to my breath than just carbon-dioxide. Beloved, as we inhale the Word of God, we exhale Life! This revelation did not just inform me, but transformed me.</p>
		  	<p>Why go after information, when you can receive revelation? More than I desire to be informed, I want to be transformed. Renew your mind, and fill it with more revelation than information. Be blessed!</p>
