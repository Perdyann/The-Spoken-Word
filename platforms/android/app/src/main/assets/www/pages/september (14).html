		  	<p><i>For an angel went down at a certain season into the pool, and troubled the water: whosoever then first after the troubling of the water stepped in was made whole of whatsoever disease he had. (John 5:4)</i></p>
		

		  	<blockquote>Until you take advantage of every stirring and movement propelled by the Word of God, you can never record any healing or miracle.</blockquote>

		  	<p>The pool of Bethesda was one that was only stirred seasonally; but whenever there was a stirring, there was a healing. For every movement the water made, a miracle was birthed.</p>
		  	<p>This healing was not just for everyone that jumped into the pool, but the very first person that took advantage of the stirring. It might have been possible for everyone to get into the pool, but was infeasible for some to be the first.</p>
		  	<p>One thing was common between all the people who sat by the pool of Bethesda; they were all impaired and limited by an infirmity.</p>
		  	<p>Considering that all of them around the pool were impaired by different sorts of infirmity, ranging impotency, blindness, paralysis, amongst others; it must have been really difficult for some to be the first to get in.</p>
		  	<p>I can imagine how a paralyzed man will move himself into the pool faster than a man who is merely impotent. Some folks considered it impossible, some were in their situation for as long as thirty-eight years, some had no one to help them.</p>
		  	<p>The struggle to get into the pool first was real, but one thing remained certain; there was healing in the pool. The wise ones however, were sure to linger around the boundaries of the pool, so that they could make every jerk at a slight stirring of the waters.</p>
		  	<p>This situation can easily be related to the stirring propelled by the release of revelations from the Word of God. I understand that in a congregation where the Word is preached, not everyone leaves as edified as others. Why? They did not jump in, when the pool was stirred.</p>
		  	<p>There is always a miracle when you respond to the movement; there is always healing when you respond to the stirring. When we meditate on the Word, pray in the Holy Ghost, and listen to edifying words and messages, our Spirit gets stirred up inside. At such seasons, nothing remains impossible!</p>
		  	<p>The people of that era located their healing in the pool, beloved, locate your healing in God’s Word; therein lies the solution to every ill situation. Until you take advantage of every stirring and movement propelled by the Word of God, you can never record any healing or miracle.</p>
		  	<p>What guaranteed healing was not just being seated by the pool side, but making every effort to jump in when it’s stirred.</p>
		  	<p>Lambano is the Greek Word meaning to receive, grasp or seize. What guarantees the miracle is not merely being seated in a congregation where the Word is preached, but being able to connect to the Word, and receive it.</p>
		  	<p>Beloved, just like the pool, my Spirit is stirred up inside to declare to someone that the era of limitations, impairments and denial is over; greater is coming; a new season is here; things can only get better; you are next in line for that miracle; it is your time to shine.</p>
		  	<p>Today, meditate on the Word of God, stir up your Spirit with powerful confessions; pray in the Holy Ghost and grasp what is rightly yours’. Be blessed!</p>
