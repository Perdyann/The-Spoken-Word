		  	<p><i>And he brought us out from thence, that he might bring us in, to give us the land which he sware unto our fathers.</i></p>
		  	<p><i>And the Lord commanded us to do all these statutes, to fear the Lord our God, for our good always, that he might preserve us alive, as it is at this day. (Deuteronomy 6:23-24)</i></p>


		  	<blockquote>Every purpose has got challenges, trials and battles attracted to it, but purpose outlives them all. A life outside purpose defines vulnerability. </blockquote>

		  	<p>The Lord redeemed the people of Israel, from Egypt (captivity) for a purpose: so that He might give them an inheritance. Purpose was what prompted God’s action.</p>
		  	<p>The only reason why the Israelites were not crushed and defeated by the Egyptians is that purpose preserved them. The commandments and statutes given to the Israelites were propelled by God’s intention to preserve them for a purpose.</p>
		  	<p>The enemy battles ferociously against purpose. The Israelites as a nation had a purpose to fulfill; they were the people of the Lord, through whom God was to manifest His glory and spoken Words. In a bid to hinder them from fulfilling their purpose, the enemy tried to keep them in a frustrated state of captivity. Who can battle with the Lord?</p>
		  	<p>Moses had a purpose! He was the vessel through whom God was to liberate the Israelites, and lead them to their promise land. The enemy foreknew the purpose of Moses, and fought against it right from the time of his birth; all to no avail.</p>
		  	<p>After he could be hidden no more, he was adopted by the Kings daughter; in essence, he was trained, fed and nurtured under the roof of the enemy of his destiny. He would have been killed an infant; Purpose preserved him!</p>
		  	<p>Jesus came for a purpose! You are the purpose Jesus came for. He came to give us the grace and liberty that the law could never give. The enemy fought against His purpose, even from his birth. He was the only one above the law that claimed the lives of all male infants. Purpose preserved him!</p>
		  	<p>Herod was once a male child, but was not confined to any law of death. Why then was it during the time of Moses and Jesus that the law of the death of male children was established and executed? They were not ordinary; they carried a Divine purpose!</p>
		  	<p>The reason why Saul never died, until his encounter with God, is that purpose preserved him; the reason why you were not killed in that plague in your city, is that purpose preserved you; they reason why you were not affected by that cruel law, is that purpose preserved you; the reason why you were not defeated by that trial, is that purpose preserved you. Be grateful!</p>
		  	<p>The major mistake men make, is regarding the preservation of purpose, as mere occurrences or coincidences.</p>
		  	<p>God is the giver of Divine purpose; every man was created for a purpose. There is a purpose, which fulfillment prompted our birth. When anyone positions himself to fight against Divine purpose, he has just gotten engaged in a battle with God, which he can never complete. Who can battle with the Lord?</p>
		  	<p>Every purpose has got challenges, trials and battles attracted to it, but purpose outlives them all.</p>
		  	<p>The enemy tries to challenge and limit men of purpose in every way. Just like Moses, Jesus, Esther, Joseph, Abraham, etc; men of purpose always encounter extraordinary trials and challenges, but purpose has the capacity to preserve.</p>
		  	<p>Beloved, when you are being tried in every way, and challenged at every second; understand that you are a man of purpose, and your purpose has the capacity to preserve you. A life outside purpose defines vulnerability. Be blessed!</p>
