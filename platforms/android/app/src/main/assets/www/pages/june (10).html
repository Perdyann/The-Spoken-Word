		  	<p><i>Rejoicing in hope; patient in tribulation; continuing instant in prayer; (Romans 12:12)</i></p>

		  	<blockquote>Victory is not measured by the magnitude of trials we face, but the attitude, with which we handle them. </blockquote>

		  	<p>I am yet to see a great man that has never been tried. The seed of greatness in you must pass through the fires of trials for it to be proven. However, trial remains something, which many are unwilling to experience. The thing they fail to realize is that trial is the gateway to glory.</p>
		  	<p>If you are not tried, you can never be better than who you are. Despite all that God had promised Abraham, it was still mandatory for him to go through trials, before he could access his promise.</p>
		  	<p>God might have spoken great words over your life, but verily, for those words to be made manifest, there’d have to be a trial. Every single Word that God gives you, must be tried. When God speaks, trials arise, before the glory of the Word is manifested.</p>
		  	<p>When Jesus spoke to Peter, and called him to walk on the water with Him, he had not even walked long, before the storms began to roar against him. At that juncture, the only thing that would have sustained him on top of the water would have been his attitude to the trial.</p>
		  	<p>Beloved, it is amazing how various men experience very similar challenges in life, and they’re tried in very similar ways, yet some are overcome by trials, while others remain victorious in it. Obviously, the difference is not the trials we encounter, but our response to them.</p>
		  	<p>Victory is not measured by the magnitude of trials we face, but the attitude, with which we handle them.</p>
		  	<p>When you’ve found yourself, in such a trial that has claimed the lives of those that went before you, what attitude should you have? Should you act in fear or faith?</p>
		  	<p>Beloved, the scripture today gives the answer to the long harbored question in the minds of many. What should our attitude be in times of challenges?</p>
		  	<p>Rejoice in hope! There is a difference between being happy, and rejoicing. Being happy is conditional; it is easy to be happy when we are rested in our comfort zone. However, it could be quite tasking to act happy, when the present situations of things are not so straight.</p>
		  	<p>Unlike happiness, rejoicing is spiritual and unconditional. Rejoicing is an inward stirring and expression of the joy of the Holy Ghost in you. It is done without any iota of fear or doubt at all, but with complete faith and confidence in God. When you are tried in diverse ways, rejoice in hope. It is not enough to hope that things will get better; but rejoice and be gladdened in the Spirit. Nothing can drain the strength of a joyous man. (Nehemiah 8:10)</p>
		  	<p>Furthermore, be patient in tribulations! He that has not learnt patience in God is not ready for any good thing yet. Good things require patience. Patience is one of the fruits of the Spirit. Job was tried in all ways, but never denied God; he patiently waited on God to unveil the glory of his latter days. Not many may have been that patient.</p>
		  	<p>It is written, “But he that shall endure unto the end, the same shall be saved. (Matthew 24:13).” Notice, the glory is not just for anyone that endures, but those, whose endurance will last till the very end. He that does not know how to wait will not soar in high places.</p>
		  	<p>In addition, we must be constant in prayers! Never stop praying; never get weary of prayers. When you pray in the Holy Ghost, and receive revelation with faith, from God’s Word, nothing can stand in your way.</p>
		  	<p>In times of trial, constantly hold on to the Word of God in prayer. The realm, where your ability cannot take you, a prayer of faith can usher you there.</p>
		  	<p>Beloved, there is no greater assurance we can have, than the conviction of God’s Word. If God’s Word can define the right attitude we should have in trials, then certainly, there is no trial we cannot overcome. Be blessed!</p>
