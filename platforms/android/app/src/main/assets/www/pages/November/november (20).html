		  <div class="panel-body" style="text-align:justify">


		  	<p><i>And the LORD said unto me, Behold, I have begun to give Sihon and his land before thee: begin to possess, that thou mayest inherit his land. (Deuteronomy 2:31)</i></p>

		  	<blockquote>God has released great virtues and blessings to us, but until we take hold of them, they cannot be manifest.</blockquote>

		  	<p>It is interesting to note the expression of this inheritance. Notice, it is not said that the Lord will give Sihon, rather, it is said that He has already begun to give Sihon. In essence, Sihon has already been given.</p>
		  	<p>The Lord has fulfilled His role by giving us all that we need for our entire lifetime; He has given us all treasures already. However, this cannot be inherited until it is possessed.</p>
		  	<p>The meaning of possess is to take hold of something; Here’s the point, God has released great virtues and blessings to us, but until we take hold of them, they cannot be manifest. Until you possess (take-hold), you cannot inherit.</p>
		  	<p>An inheritance is a property, right or title that is transferred to an heir; we have an inheritance as Sons of God; however, we cannot tap into our inheritance until we lay hold of it (possess). Ignorance is what prevents a man from laying hold of that, which is actually his. Little wonder the scripture says,</p>
		  	<p><i>I mean that the heir, as long as he is a child, is no different from a slave, though he is the owner of everything (Galatians 4:1 ESV)</i></p>
		  	<p>Until a child grows to the realization of his inheritance, and possesses it, he lives like a slave. Children are ignorant of their rights; they are at the mercy of their tutors. Likewise beloved, until you come to the realization of who you are in Christ, and lay hold of your inheritance, you’d remain at the mercy of the merciless devil.</p>
		  	<p>The scripture rightly states, possess, that ye may inherit. Possession comes before inheritance. Until you possess something, you cannot have it, even though it is your birth-right.</p>
		  	<p>How then can we possess? Faith! You can never lay hold on anything in life without faith. Do you think God has not healed the people on the sick beds? He has; but until they lay hold of healing in faith, they’d remain physically impaired.</p>
		  	<p>Faith originates from the Word of God. Thus, without the Word of God, faith cannot come, and without faith, no one can possess (lay hold of) anything, and without possession, our inheritance remains void.</p>
		  	<p>The base of this equation is an in-depth knowledge of God’s Word. The only reason why Christians are living outside their inheritance is because they have not laid hold of it (possessed). This is for no other reason but ignorance; many Christians do not even know that they have an inheritance.</p>
		  	<p>We are partakers of the Divine Nature; divinity, health and prosperity are part of our inheritance. Stop living below your Divine Status. Take possession of that, which is yours’ and live abundantly. Be blessed!</p>
