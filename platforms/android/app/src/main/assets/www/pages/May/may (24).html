		  <div class="panel-body" style="text-align:justify">


		  	<p><i>But the wisdom that is from above is first pure, then peaceable, gentle, and easy to be intreated, full of mercy and good fruits, without partiality, and without hypocrisy. (James 3:17)</i></p>


		  	<blockquote>The wisdom of the world is very common, but Wisdom from above has a distinctive attractiveness that draws royals from different nations to the brightness of your light. </blockquote>

		  	<p>Beloved, this passage makes obvious the truth that there is wisdom, which is of the world, and that which is from above. The wisdom of the world is unlike that, which is from above.</p>
		  	<p>The wisdom from above is a complete package. When you get wisdom from above, it bears fruits of peace, purity, gentility, mercy, genuineness, wealth, amongst others.</p>
		  	<p>Solomon did not need to ask God for all these individual qualities; he understood that they were all subsets of Wisdom. Therefore, the wisdom he received bore him fruits of wealth, peace, and others.</p>
		  	<p>It is confirmed in Proverbs 4:7, that wisdom is the principal thing. The use of the term ‘principal’ in qualifying wisdom, entails that it is the most important thing. An organization cannot operate without a principal; thus Solomon’s kingdom could not be successful without the principal thing — wisdom.</p>
		  	<p>However, we must understand that the wisdom described as the principal thing, is not just any kind of wisdom. It is written:</p>
		  	<p><i>For the wisdom of this world is foolishness with God. For it is written, He taketh the wise in their own craftiness. (1 Corinthians 3:9)</i></p>
		  	<p>Therefore, that which the world regards as wisdom is seen as folly in the eyes of God. No amount of reputable degrees—PhD, MSc or Bsc—can ever give you genuine wisdom. You can learn from experiences, tutors can teach you principles, men can mentor you, but only God gives wisdom.</p>
		  	<p>Queen Sheba travelled all the way to meet with Solomon, not just because he was wise, but because he operated with an uncommon, and distinct kind of wisdom. Verily, the wisdom of the world is very common, but Wisdom from above has a distinctive attractiveness that draws royals from different nations to the brightness of your light. Paul confirms all these by saying,</p>
		  	<p><i>Howbeit we speak wisdom among them that are perfect: yet not the wisdom of this world, nor of the princes of this world, that come to nought:</i></p>
		  	<p><i>But we speak the wisdom of God in a mystery, even the hidden wisdom, which God ordained before the world unto our glory: (1 Corinthians 2:6-7)</i></p>
		  	<p>In essence, the wisdom of the world is of no value or profit whatsoever; it sums up to nothing! But the wisdom which we speak is of God, and was ordained before the world.</p>
		  	<p>Beloved, operating by the wisdom of the world adds no value to your life; it gives you very common results, but the Wisdom from above sets you apart for greatness. How then can you get wisdom from above?</p>
		  	<p>Genuine wisdom, which is fruitful, comes from above. Such wisdom is only given by God; thus to discover it, you must start by discovering God.</p>
		  	<p>When you become born again, and receive the Holy Spirit into your life, He resides in you, with the fullness of Wisdom, Knowledge and Understanding. You only have to grow in it, by constant meditation of the Word, and prayer in the Holy Ghost. Be blessed!</p>
