		  	<p><i>Thus saith the LORD to his anointed, to Cyrus, whose right hand I have holden, to subdue nations before him; and I will loose the loins of kings, to open before him the two leaved gates; and the gates shall not be shut; </i></p>
		  	<p><i>I will go before thee, and make the crooked places straight: I will break in pieces the gates of brass, and cut in sunder the bars of iron: (Isaiah 45:1-2)</i></p>

		  	<blockquote>In times of uncertainty, insecurity and future anxiety, take solace in the truth that God has already dealt with the challenges ahead of you. Walk confidently into your destiny. </blockquote>

		  	<p>Everything else was merely created, but man was created to subdue and have dominion (Genesis 1:28). There is a great purpose for the creation of every man; so great is your destiny.</p>
		  	<p>Sometimes, when we consider the magnitude of the mandate, which God has given us to fulfill, we may begin to wonder how we could ever achieve all of that. How can we really take over the nations with the gospel of Christ?</p>
		  	<p>I am pretty sure Joseph must have at one point thought about how he would have been able to get to that place of his destiny, which he never ceased to visualize.</p>
		  	<p>At some point, Abraham may have thought about how he would have become the Father of Many Nations, and fulfilled his destiny.</p>
		  	<p>Moses may have also thought about how he will lead the Israelites out of captivity, into their promise land.</p>
		  	<p>Beloved, God went before them all! He leveled the exalted places; he made straight the crooked places; he parted the sea; he gave them favor in the sight of all. No matter how mighty their destinies seemed initially, they eventually conquered obstacles and arrived!</p>
		  	<p>In times of uncertainty, insecurity and future anxiety, take solace in the truth that God has already dealt with the challenges ahead of you. Walk confidently into your destiny.</p>
		  	<p>Just like Joseph, some of us have visions to encompass; we have destinies to be fulfilled; we have purposes to live; we have dreams to achieve; and all of these are within God’s ideal plan for our lives. Take this Word—God has gone before you already!</p>
		  	<p>Today, God is speaking to His anointed—there is no need to be bothered about how you will subdue nations; there is no need to be worried about how the gates will open up; there is no need to worry about the challenges ahead. The Lord has gone before you already.</p>
		  	<p>The whole story of Joseph, about how he was going to be betrayed by his brothers, how he was going to be tempted by Potiphar’s wife and how he was going to be connected to the Kingdom through prison, was already written long ago. The Lord had already gone ahead of him.</p>
		  	<p>Beloved, the story of your life has been written, and it is a beautiful one. Be anxious for nothing, the Lord has secured your future already. Be blessed!</p>
