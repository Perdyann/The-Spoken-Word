		  	<p><i>And Philip said, If thou believest with all thine heart, thou mayest. And he answered and said, I believe that Jesus Christ is the Son of God.</i></p>
		  	<p><i>And he commanded the chariot to stand still: and they went down both into the water, both Philip and the eunuch; and he baptized him. (Acts 8:37-38)</i></p>

		  	<blockquote>You will never understand the magnitude of opportunities ahead of you, until you start walking in obedience. </blockquote>

		  	<p>Philip’s encounter with the Ethiopian eunuch is a very remarkable one; it was one of such meetings that did not just happen by chance, but was divinely orchestrated.</p>
		  	<p>Philip was in Macedonia, when the Angel commanded him turn towards the desert, he was probably wondering why the Angel will just direct him to the desert.</p>
		  	<p>Right there, he bumped into an Ethiopian eunuch, who happened to be reading the book of Isaiah without understanding. As he was led by the Spirit of God, he explained the scripture to him, led him to Christ, and baptized him, after which he immediately vanished.</p>
		  	<p>The Ethiopian eunuch happened to be a man of great authority under the queen. He must have been influential.</p>
		  	<p>Here’s the point, he must have shared his divine experience with the entire nation, and that may have led many to Christ. An entire nation might have been saved as a result of that Divine encounter.</p>
		  	<p>Furthermore, as I kept pondering on this passage, a thought kept crossing my mind — How important is the salvation of one man, the eunuch, that God sent Philip all the way from Macedonia to meet him in the desert?</p>
		  	<p>Do you have an idea how important you are to God? For your sake alone, God could establish a Divine connection that will lead to a nation-saving encounter. Just like the parable of the lost sheep, and lost coin; God values and celebrates the salvation of one lost soul.</p>
		  	<p>It is amazing how Divine connections are established; it is amazing how mighty encounters emerge from a little act of obedience. If Philip had disobeyed and journeyed his way, he would have missed out on that encounter.</p>
		  	<p>More amazing is the fact that for one man’s issue, God sent a solution from afar. The eunuch was not the one who went in search of the solution bearer—Philip; he did not run helter skelter in search of understanding; as a result of the Divine connection, what he needed was made available to him right where he was.</p>
		  	<p>Beloved, God is a master strategist; He has a way of bringing to us, the desire we’ve always had.</p>
		  	<p>Just like the Eunuch, you might be going through the desert stage of your life; it might seem like there is no one around to come to your aid; worry not, God has already established a Divine connection.</p>
		  	<p>Just like Philip, you might hear the voice of the Lord lead you in a certain direction in life; don’t shun that voice, obey! You will never understand the magnitude of opportunities ahead of you, until you start walking in obedience.</p>
		  	<p>For every Divine connection, we have a role to play - obedience! Many have missed out of the great plans God had for them, as a result of disobedience.</p>
		  	<p>Be confident in this Word, God has already gone ahead of you, to establish the right connections you need; the solution to your problem will locate you, even in the desert where you are. Be blessed!</p>
