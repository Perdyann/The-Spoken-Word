		  	<blockquote>When our message does more condemnation than edification, it is not the gospel. </blockquote>

		  	<p>Paul, in his first letter to the church in Corinth, made it clear that the attitude is as important as the message communicated.</p>
		  	<p>So often, we try to minister the Word of God to the world, but we do it with a wrong attitude, thus, we are misunderstood. The Word of God is true, but when it is translated with a wrong attitude, it is portrayed as being false.</p>
		  	<p>Here’s the point, we have been given the Ministry of reconciliation; our focus is to reconcile the world to God, and not to condemn. When our message does more condemnation than edification, it is not the gospel.</p>
		  	<p>Although Paul was not a Jew, he became like a Jew; although he was free, he became like a servant. Why? For the sake of the gospel! He related with everyone based on their level, so that he might save some by every means.</p>
		  	<p>It takes wisdom to translate the truth of God’s Word; the message of the gospel should liberate the oppressed—if they are not liberated by it, then probably, you have not translated it properly (with the right attitude).</p>
		  	<p>Charles Capps once quoted, “No matter how great the truths you teach, if they are not received, you have failed.” Don’t turn everyone off by your dogmatic means of presenting the truth. Relate with people on the level they are in.</p>
		  	<p>Sometime ago, I was speaking to a colleague, and he began to make complains about his financial status, which eventually led him to make some negative confessions. I immediately shut him up and rebuked him.</p>
		  	<p>I wouldn’t do that to just anyone, but based on his level, I did not expect him to make such statements . . . he appreciated my manner of correction, but not everyone will.</p>
		  	<p>Someone who is not born-again or perhaps newly born-again will not appreciate that rebuke, because he has not yet understood the place of confession in producing results. To such people, I will calmly begin to teach those principles afresh.</p>
		  	<p>Verily, it is not all about teaching the truth, but doing it rightly. Therefore, we must learn to relate with people at their level. Even Jesus had to relate with his disciples based on their level of understanding, that’s why He always taught in parables.</p>
		  	<p>When Lazarus died, Jesus, understanding the Kingdom vocabulary, did not outrightly state that he is dead. Instead, he stated that Lazarus is asleep. However, seeing that his disciples did not understand, he then had to speak to them in their understanding, by saying that he is dead.</p>
		  	<p>When Jesus needed to teach about perseverance in prayers, he used the parable of the widow and fearless king; when he needed to teach about the kingdom, he taught in different parables (earthly stories with heavenly meaning), in order for them to understand.</p>
		  	<p>Preaching the gospel is not an obligation, which we just do, in order to fulfill all righteousness. No! Don’t just preach to fulfil the fact that you have preached, relate well with the people you preach to, so that your message might be received in understanding.</p>
		  	<p>Share the gospel with someone today, and do it in love, patience and understanding. Do not outrightly portray the people of the world as sinners; give them hope in the Word of God. Be blessed!</p>
