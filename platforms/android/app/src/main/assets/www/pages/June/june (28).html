		  	<p><i>I returned, and saw under the sun, that the race is not to the swift, nor the battle to the strong, neither yet bread to the wise, nor yet riches to men of understanding, nor yet favour to men of skill; but time and chance happeneth to them all. (Ecclesiastes 9:11)</i></p>

		  	<blockquote>The difference between the fastest man and the winner of the race is only a blend of time and chance.</blockquote>

		  	<p>Ever wondered why the fastest man does not always win the race; the strong sometimes lose the battle; sometimes, wise men go hungry, and men of understand remain miserable; skillful men don’t always qualify for great positions.</p>
		  	<p>Verily, time and chance happeneth to them all. The importance of timing and opportunity cannot be overemphasized. The difference between the fastest man and the winner of the race is only a blend of time and chance.</p>
		  	<p>Time and opportunity work together to produce success. Having an opportunity at a time when you are not prepared for it, will only make it void. However, when opportunity meets a man that has patiently waited for it in all preparedness, success becomes inevitable.</p>
		  	<p>There are opportunities that I got in life, but could not take advantage of, because they showed up at wrong times.</p>
		  	<p>Your strength is not enough to help you win the battles of life; having understanding is not enough assurance of riches; your speed is not a guarantee that the race is yours’ to be won; but taking advantage of right opportunities that come at the right time.</p>
		  	<p>At the right time, platforms and opportunities are launched in the realm of the Spirit, to act in your favor.</p>
		  	<p>I always thought I could rush over things in life; in my understanding, I thought it wise to rush God’s timing, but in everything, I realized that God’s time is the best.</p>
		  	<p>When we insist on walking in our own ways, grabbing every single opportunity, even at the wrong time, we only end up living a life that revolves around circles, and coming to learn the hard way after many years have already been wasted.</p>
		  	<p>If there is one thing I desire that every man gets to understand, it is God’s timing. God might have spoken great words about our lives, and placed a vision in our minds, but without an understanding of the times and seasons in the Spirit, we cannot fully live out that vision and life.</p>
		  	<p>Trying to manifest a great vision at the wrong time will only pronounce that vision vulnerable.</p>
		  	<p>Joseph had great dreams and visions, but he understood timing and opportunity. Even though he envisaged greatness day and night, he never tried to manifest it by his own ability.</p>
		  	<p>When the right time for the manifestation of that vision arrived, God used his brothers to create an opportunity that connected him to Potiphar, the prison, and then the Palace. All that happened to Joseph was a beautiful blend of time and opportunity.</p>
		  	<p>Beloved, your level of skills, swiftness, wittiness, or expertise is not all that is required to launch you to the place of your destiny. You need a beautiful blend of time and chance (opportunity).</p>
		  	<p>Having a great vision is not all about it, you need to understand its timing. People say, “opportunity comes but once; grab it anytime it shows up”, but God’s Word makes us to understand that not every opportunity is of God; thus when it is time for the manifestation of our vision, the rightful opportunities show up.</p>
		  	<p>Don’t be in a hurry to accept junk, when greater things are lined up for you in time to come. Greater is coming. Be blessed!</p>
