		  	<p><i>serving the Lord with all humility and with tears and with trials that happened to me through the plots of the Jews; how I did not shrink from declaring to you anything that was profitable, and teaching you in public and from house to house, (Acts 20: 19-20 ESV)</i></p>


		  	<blockquote>Our reaction to heat reveals who we really are. Your extent of originality is defined by the degree of heat you are able to withstand.</blockquote>

		  	<p>Some years ago, while my sister was still in the University, back in Nigeria, she had an academic excursion over the weekend. She had made all preparations for her trip. I recall her hair was all made; her bags were all packed, as she anticipated the trip.</p>
		  	<p>The night before her trip, something happened. She was in kitchen, preparing a meal, but for some reason, the fire came up too high from the gas; it did not touch her, but the heat shrunk her hair so bad.</p>
		  	<p>No matter how hard she tried to get her hair back in shape, it just couldn’t be as straight as it was before. This was simply because the hair she made was synthetic, and not the natural human-hair.</p>
		  	<p>The natural human hair can withstand an extent of heat, but synthetic hair shrinks over the lowest degree of heat.</p>
		  	<p>That particular event gave me more insight on the power of heat. It is amazing how heat makes people, things, and object shrink.</p>
		  	<p>Nylon does not need to be thrown into the fire before it melts; the heat is enough to make it shrink; but a piece of cloth (cotton) might actually need to touch the fire before it burns. This is because cotton is stronger than nylon.</p>
		  	<p>Beloved, our reaction to heat reveals who we really are. Your extent of originality is defined by the degree of heat you are able to withstand.</p>
		  	<p>The heat represents trials, challenges and tribulations; the reaction of objects to heat can be likened to our reaction to persecution and distress.</p>
		  	<p>Peter, speaking to the early believers, described how the heat (plot of the Jews) was not able to make him shrink from fulfilling that, which he had been called to do. He spoke about how he endured the heat, without shrinking, for the sake of the Gospel.</p>
		  	<p>Today, I just want to ask, “How much heat can you endure for the sake of the Gospel? How original are you?”</p>
		  	<p>It is embarrassing how people shrink, even at the slightest heat they feel. For something to be called gold, it must have passed through fire, without perishing. Likewise, for you to be fulfilled, you must be willing to endure the heat.</p>
		  	<p>Furthermore, we realize that the same degree of heat, that straightens the human hair, shrinks synthetic hair. It is up to you to decide what heat does to you; does it shrink you or straighten you?</p>
		  	<p>Peter did not shrink because of the plot of the Jews; rather, he was challenged to do more for the sake of the Gospel.</p>
		  	<p>Beloved, choose not to be shrunk by persecutions, but straightened by them. Choose not to be broken by trials, but to be made by them. The very stone that caused others to stumble, will take you a step higher today. Be blessed!</p>
